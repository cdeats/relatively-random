										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not your typical “grieving teacher” post. Trust me, I have grieved. Hard.</p>



<p>&#8230;but today, I reported to my classroom for the first time since March 12, 2020. It’s almost time to close up shop for the summer.</p>



<p>As I approached the doorway, I couldn’t help but notice the “Pandemic Cleaning Checklist” that hung on the door. I pulled my mask down so I could anxiously exhale and clearly view the steps our custodians took to make the environment safe. Then, I turned the key and entered.</p>



<p>Everything else was just as we had left it. The setting was eerie, in mildly post-apocalyptic way.</p>



<p>Lucas’ handwriting greeted me from the whiteboard — in bold purple marker, it reminded me of his campaign to be my favorite student.</p>



<p>Our field trip bus request and permission forms peeked out of a yellow folder I had prepared for an upcoming special event I had planned with some of my teacher soul-sisters from other districts.</p>



<p>A few leftover Class of 2020 t-shirt order forms puddled up on a student desk near mine.</p>



<p>I quickly sprayed the markerboard and wiped it clean. I tossed the order forms and the field trip folder into the trash. Many other stacks and bundles followed. I purge. It’s what I do to put the past in the past.</p>



<p>For over six weeks, I have maintained communication and connection strictly through digital means. I have driven past homes, honking and waving at precious friends in their yards and I have briefly chatted with my parents in their driveway when I dropped off supplies.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Folks, it is not the same. You can see the proof in the photo on the left. That woman has had limited real human interaction for the last month.</p>



<p>Do you see the fear in her eyes?<br>Do see the darkness?</p>



<p>Now look at the face on the right. That face is relaxed, smiling, and glowing. That is the face of a teacher who is back in her element, hitting reset, reflecting, and making plans for the future. It’s the countenance of a woman who spent just a few minutes chatting eye to eye with colleagues in the high school hallways. These images were taken just a couple of healing hours apart. Clearly, face-to-face interaction is a steroid, and we all need a shot.</p>



<p>I am not mourning any longer.<br>Our students are going to be okay.<br>We are going to be okay.</p>



<p>We have to allow ourselves to be.</p>



<p>Ready yourself to overcome this.<br>Plan to put the past in the past.<br>Prepare to purge the fear.<br>Get ready to glow!!</p>The post <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/2020/04/ready-set-glow/">Ready, Set, Glow</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was with great anticipation that we waited for tonight, the opening of Disney’s latest release, Beauty and the Beast. A tale as old as time, Beauty and the Beast is back on the big screen this weekend, this time in a live-action format. As we have come to expect from Disney Studios, the film’s gorgeous costumes, its breath-taking sets, delightful special effects, and its current themes are certain to appeal to modern moviegoers.</p>
<p>Disney piqued our curiosity through social media. We first learned of this adaptation through Facebook trailers that used a split-screen method to show viewers key scenes from the 1991 classic and the 2017 overhaul, and we sentimentally fell intrigued with the intentional similarities. We were interested to see how the animated version we knew would translate to the live-action format. Would the dinner plates perform in Technicolor brilliance? Would the beast be realistic enough to fear … and to love? Would Gaston be as irresistible in human form as he thinks he is in Animation Land? (To our delight, Gaston, played by Luke Evans – Fast and Furious 6, 2013; Girl on the Train, 2016 – can SING, though we still dislike the character as much as we did in 1991.)</p>
<p>After our enjoyable experience with the recent Cinderella remake, we trusted that this film would measure up, or even surpass its predecessor.</p>
<p>We entered the sold-out theatre on opening night. Our expectations were high. Instantly, we were captivated by a flashback that shows the prince (before the spell) entertaining at a ball that makes bibliophiles like Belle think of Edgar Allan Poe’s “Masque of the Red Death.” It’s dark and ominous, symbolizing the joyless life the prince lives even before he transforms. Soon, the flashback melts away, and we are in the present setting, enchanted and singing along with the familiar lines of the opening song. Fans will know the words. (Oh, and there are a handful of other literary allusions that will make your high school English teacher proud.)</p>
<p>The movie remained consistent for several scenes, and that was satisfactory for us, but Disney must have anticipated that some audiences would appreciate something original with the “remake.” Thus, they incorporated a story unexplored in the animation – the backstory of Belle’s mother. (Rarely do we see a mother figure in a Disney story line. Have you noticed this too?) Viewers will appreciate this explanation and the more developed and sympathetic character that is her father.</p>
<p>As a mother and teacher, I first thought of the one of the strongest themes of this plot: “Don’t judge one by his or her appearance.” Yes! We certainly can’t argue with the importance of that message, and this adaptation delivered on that point, but it provides more. Feminists will be pleased to see Belle is the inventor in this version, not her father. (Wait until you see what she engineers!) Disney offers a new dimension, a modern message for the young women in the audience: There is so much more for you than just what you have planned for yourself. This lesson, along with others about how to behave when others mock you make this movie one to share with young women. Additionally, the key scene when Belle climbs the bluff to “the great wide somewhere” is more than just literal.</p>
<p>Viewers will also appreciate a new understanding to His Royalty’s roar. He’s not just having a bad fur day.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this film is good. We sang, we laughed, we reminisced, and (we admit) we cried more than just a few quiet tears due to its heartbreaking undercurrent of homesickness. We think it will make a good film for your family to share this weekend. Its PG rating is due to the scary moments you may remember from the animation – creepy woods, aggressive wolves, a fight scene at the resolution. Additionally, if you’ve read other reviews, you realize you may have to field some questions about the relationship between LeFou and some of the other characters, but the tendencies may be ambiguous enough to sneak past young viewers. We encourage each of you to take this issue into consideration. Furthermore, the notion that a person needs somebody else to complete him or free him from some sort of captivity is somewhat perturbing, but the movie offered us more enjoyment than disappointment. Thus, we invite you to “be our guest” and spend a little time with Beauty and her beast.</p>The post <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-a-review-of-this-disney-remake/">Beauty and the Beast – A review of this Disney remake</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

I practiced with paint &#8212;<br />
eyes, cheeks, lips.</p>
<p>The New York summer<br />
dragged on, humid and misty.</p>
<p>Cousin&#8217;s grunge bands<br />
jammed out the angst we all felt<br />
in those days</p>

I knew the words to your song instinctively.</p>
<p>Your anthem pulled me to the window   .<br />
You had your head in the engine of a GMC.<br />
Your hands, young, but capable<br />
manipulated horsepower and torque<br />
and the promise of the American highway.</p>
<p>I could feel the heat of your body<br />
rise<br />
two stories up&#8211;<br />
steam through cotton.</p>
<p>The universe told me what to do,<br />
but I turned back to my reflection,<br />
tamed my wildness into a prim braid,<br />
blotted my lip gloss<br />
and only thought about<br />
slipping my fingers<br />
through your belt loops<br />
and turning you around to face me.</p>The post <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/2016/07/heat/">Heat</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we bring these lines to you, one of our favorite writers is receiving the high honor in New York City. No, it’s not our favorite novelist winning the Pulitzer Award for Fiction or our most well-loved poet winning the Frost Medal … it’s one of our favorite songwriters, Tom Petty, and he is being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. While Petty has already received numerous accolades for his Rock and Roll genius, we are especially excited about this commendation because it is, at its heart, about what we are about – the word, the image, the verse, the character, the story. In fact, one of our RR writers credits Petty’s songwriting in her own development as a writer. “I became aware of the cleverness of songwriting when I was about fourteen years old,” she recalls. “My uncle copied some of his favorite CDs onto blank tapes for my mother and me to take on an upcoming cross-country drive. The Traveling Wilburys [a band comprised of rock legends like Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison] album was one he shared, as we drove across some of the uneventful portions of the nation, the lyrics of these songs became the landscape for me. I memorized every song, and shortly thereafter, Petty released his solo album FULL MOON FEVER. I wasn’t old enough to have a job to make money of my own, and I certainly didn’t have a car to get me to the record stores, so I quickly became a Columbia House member, and built my complete Tom Petty musical library through this mail-order service. His lyrics are the stories of my life. His songs motivated me as I completed English class essays. His voice played as I attempted to complete Algebra problems. His stories escorted me as I moved away to college. Maybe having his creativity present while I was wrestling with intellectual tasks helped me understand or appreciate his craft. Perhaps because I was in a process of putting things together and taking things apart I was able to say, ‘Oh, I see what he did there.’” Many people have similar experiences with Tom Petty’s song writing. It’s probably safe to say that most rock and roll fans have at least one special memory that is instantly called to the forefront when “America Girl” or “Free Fallin’,” for example, begins to play.</p>
<p>His images, characters, and anthems have earned him admission into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Like a poet, he has the uncanny ability to find gold in what he observes, like an artist making masterpieces of regular-life scenes. Take, for example, the opening lines of “Free Fallin’.” Though he admits in a recent interview that he wrote those iconic lines as a way to make his friend Jeff Lynne laugh, they paint a picture of an ordinary life to whom his audience can relate. “She’s a good girl, loves her mama/ loves Jesus and America too,” Petty writes. “She’s a good girl, crazy ‘bout Elvis/ loves horses and her boyfriend too.” This image of an All-American life resonates with listeners, and even some of his lesser-known lyrics provide fans with images that seem to be more from a poet than from a rock star. In his 1987 track “It’ll All Work Out,” he opens with a clever simile that transforms the song to a poetic work: “She wore faded jeans and soft black leather/ she had eyes so blue, they looked like weather.” While he might have made these words choices for the sake of the rhyme, the use of the simile provides the audience with a subtly symbolic reference they can ponder. Die-hard music fans might even consider an image like this to be an allusion to Willie Nelson’s single “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain” (Fred Rose, 1975). Songwriting like this gives listeners much to consider, which is why Petty is deserving of this commemoration…and with dozen of albums to his credit, fans have ample opportunity to analyze.</p>
<p>Images like these are one element of Petty’s songwriting that give him credence to this induction, and the characters that he has created are equally important. Consider the heroines he has crafted. There’s the legendary “American Girl” (1977) or Mary Jane (“Mary Jane’s Last Dance,” 1993), just to name a couple, and the narratives of these characters remind us of the girls we used to know, the young ladies we want to know, the daughters we used to be, and the women we wish we were.</p>
<p>… but above all, the musical compositions of Tom Petty include themes of doing what you know is right, standing up for what you believe in, and working hard, making him a staple of American songwriting.</p>
<p>We are excited about Tom Petty’s induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and agree that it is most well-deserved honor. We congratulate him on his continued success in the industry, and thank him for the decades of great story-telling he has brought to our ears and hearts.</p>The post <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/2016/06/tom-petty-inducted-into-the-songwriters-hall-of-fame-and-were-happy-about-it/">Tom Petty Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame…and we’re happy about it</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer began on Friday night. At least that’s when the people from the areas around small town Grayson, Kentucky observed its start. Typically, Memorial Day weekend is a special event for the residents of this community, as they line the streets with games, vendors, food dealers, live music performers, and other standard festival features, but this year, this small town went big! For their Memory Days event, a local business sponsored a free live concert from the rising country music group Old Dominion. News of this special event spread from traditional news outlets and over social media, and soon, thousands of music lovers had “Old Dominion Block Party” written on their calendars and typed into their phones’ reminders.</p>
<p>We had heard that city officials expected nearly 8,000 people for the block party, so I knew to get into my Relatively Random t-shirt and grab our red collapsible lawn chairs and hit the highway for Grayson early to be there in time for the gates opening at 6:00. We arrived in plenty of time, encountered very little traffic, and found a terrific free parking spot close to the parking lot where the event was to be held. We had the place nearly to ourselves and sat up our chairs behind where the small crowd was forming. (Luckily, the other patrons left ample room between themselves and us, as we would soon need the space as a dance floor.)</p>
<p>As the first blistering hot sun of the summer moved across the sky and dropped behind the local church steeple, shade fell upon the large parking lot, setting the mood for Friday night fun. Two different local acts performed songs they had written and covers of popular hits, priming the growing crowd for the main event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4.jpg" rel="lightbox[1715]"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1711" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4-298x300.jpg" alt="olddom4" width="298" height="300" srcset="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4-298x300.jpg 298w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4-768x773.jpg 768w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4-330x332.jpg 330w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4-690x694.jpg 690w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4-576x580.jpg 576w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/olddom4.jpg 954w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a>At about 8:30, Old Dominion took the stage, opening with their current chart-topper “Snapback.” Over the nearly two hours that they performed, fans enjoyed all of the tracks from the band’s current album MEAT AND CANDY, along with some other well-known compositions the band members had written for other popular country music artists. Now, this is where we became seriously impressed. We love Old Dominion. We own their CDs and we know every word to every song, but like the title of the album suggests, most of the songs are “candy” – feel good, bubblegum tracks. Only a couple of songs give us any “meat” to provide substance, so we worried the concert might leave us a little empty, but when they shared some of the pieces they’d published previous to their pop-country success, they gained a new level of our respect.</p>

Learning that the Old Dominion guys penned these tunes impressed us tremendously, and scored them some additional street cred in our book.</p>
<p>Overall, we were very pleased with the event. We danced all night and laughed along with the band as they conversed with the crowd from their platform. Old Dominion gave a top-notch, feel-good, party-in-the-parking lot performance, leaving it all on stage, just as they would have for a larger venue. Indeed, they turned this little one-horse into Vegas.</p>
<p>We recommend that you catch them on their summer tour. You can see them at their upcoming stops to upstate New York (Canandaigua and Hunter), in good ole Nashville, way up in Wisconsin, or out on the beach in Virginia (the state from which most of the band hails).

Indeed! Our youngest sister, ironically, has enjoyed the largest number of world-wide travels, so we left the travel arrangements to her. A few months and $900 later, I found myself on the soft sands of the Mexican Riviera, enjoying unlimited frozen cocktails alongside my two gorgeous sisters. Mary described the process as amazingly simple.</p>
<p>It began with a visit to Southwest Vacations online. There are many other internet travel sites that provide equal services and comparable prices, but Mary shopped first with Southwest, a name I approved of, recognized, and trusted. Booking a trip with Southwest Vacations was as easy as booking a regular US flight with them. We named our preferred dates, saw the options of marvelous destinations, chose the type of room we wanted, and combined these simple logistics with Mary’s experience. Her knowledge of Caribbean travel and all-inclusive resorts, along with consumer reviews on TripAdvisor, helped us choose our journey’s end. As she clicked through the website’s prompts, Mary even secured transportation from the airport to the resort and back again. Southwest thought of everything! All I had to do was pay for my portion of the trip and obtain a passport. Not long after, my sisters and I left Baltimore, MD on a direct flight to Cancun, Mexico. (Southwest Airlines provides international flights to many destinations from a number of American airports, but Mary lives in MD and the three of us decided to meet there and begin our journey together.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6.jpg" rel="lightbox[1684]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1690" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-225x300.jpg" alt="mexico6" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-225x300.jpg 225w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-330x440.jpg 330w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-690x920.jpg 690w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-435x580.jpg 435w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Flying to a foreign land with a familiar airline like Southwest was a comfortable treat. The procedures and service were standard and enjoyably predictable. The flight attendants were in jolly good moods and generous, upon learning that we were celebrating a special event – with the snacks and beverages. As the four-hour flight approached its end, the crew talked us through the paperwork we each needed to complete to pass through customs without incident. We landed safely, secured our baggage without problem, and navigated through customs seamlessly. Then, the only hiccups we experienced transpired. Because our pilot has transported us so remarkably well, he actually delivered us to Cancun ahead of schedule, and unfortunately, our transportation was not ready for us. The company was expecting us, our names were on the log, and a driver was scheduled to assist us, but because our flight arrived early, we had to wait on the curb for about thirty minutes before he completed his previous run and picked us up. While this disturbed us some, we chatted with other passengers, shared travel stories, and – had we wanted one at the time – vendors provided beverages nearby. Note: Our limited Spanish proficiency did not present a problem for us as we communicated with the airport staff or shuttle service employees. Their English was good, and what Spanish we retained from high school Spanish classes decades prior was sufficient.</p>
<p>Soon, our driver arrived and cheerfully swooped up our bags. We scurried behind him and loaded into the vehicle. The last leg <a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1.jpg" rel="lightbox[1684]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1685" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-225x300.jpg" alt="mexico1" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-330x440.jpg 330w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-690x920.jpg 690w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-435x580.jpg 435w, https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>of our short journey was underway, and within about thirty minutes – all filled with friendly small talk and humorous Spanish lessons &#8212; he safely delivered us to our resort, the Iberostar Paraiso Beach. The property was beautiful. Open-air lobbies featuring large couches and plush seating welcomed us. Peacocks, swans, parrots filled the landscape with their beauty and songs. Waterways moved through the architecture, complete with beautiful fish and turtles. Generous staff members relieved us of our baggage and offered fruity cocktails in exchange. The front-desk staff greeted us with clear communication and terrific service, maps, and information about the property before connecting us quickly with the concierge, who assisted us with our meal-planning for the length of our stay.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he offered us opportunities to enjoy excursions off the premises, but the resort was so large and lovely, we did not feel the need to leave it. Our beach-front accommodations thrilled us from sunrise to our mid-afternoon siestas. The Caribbean views, clear water, near-by open-air food provisions, complementary snorkeling filled our days, and when we wanted a change of scenery, the enormous pools with their swim-up bars, ice cream parlors, and aquatic games kept us entertained each afternoon. Nightly we dined at fantastic restaurants and enjoyed prompt, complementary room service. If we desired, we could enjoy a live show after dinner or visit the dance club. On-site shopping was available as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentine’s Day takes place this weekend, and with it comes the very awkward obligation to spend time, spend money, and expend effort, all in the name of “love.” It’s the quintessential “Darned If You Do, Darned If You Don’t” hallmark, and we at Relatively Random have done a little research to make your Valentine’s Day … less … um … darned.</p>
<p>First, we considered the traditional dinner and a movie date format. Luckily, Lionsgate has released a new Nicholas Sparks’ movie just in time for the blessed day! Like the holiday, however, The Choice is a complicated option for your romantic celebration, but here is why we like it:</p>
<p>1. Flirting Lessons: If you and your sweetheart are just starting your romantic journey, the adorable bantering between the film’s lead characters will give you a clever example. The first half of the show is filled with witty jabs and cute phrases that show viewers how to be playful and polite, how to make friends and how to make up. If you’re further down the road in your relationship, however, this story is a good one for you, as well. While you may have mastered the art of flirting years ago, this reel will give you the refresher you might not even know you need. Wink, wink. Truthfully, this film is great for the non-committed viewer, too, as both of the primary actors (Benjamin Walker, Teresa Palmer) are so attractive and compelling, you’ll feel like they are flirting with you. (I certainly got my money’s worth.) Thus, this film is an option for couples and unattached audiences to enjoy.</p>
<p>2. It’s a terrible book-to-screen adaptation. This means that if your date has already read the 2007 novel upon which this movie is based, she’ll actually get a big surprise. The movie is very different from the book. (We enjoyed the movie more, actually, which pains us to say. Aren’t we always supposed to claim that the book is better than its silver screen account?) Gabby (Warm Bodies, Point Break 2015) is more believably brought to life on screen, and more likable. The storyline is essentially the same – boy meets girl, boy is smitten, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, boy loses girl again (this time in a more dramatic way) – but it contains enough plot variance and difference in character development to make the two stand alone. Therefore, the price of admission will be a good investment; the movie will provide you with something you weren’t expecting (if you were expecting a true-to-text representation).</p>
<p>3. North Carolina. Like every other Sparks’ film we’ve seen, The Choice is set on the banks of North Carolina, and this one celebrates the waterways that flow between the mainland and the open sea. It is full of beautiful landscape shots, images of coastal activities such as fishing, boating, and picnics, and tours of unique waterfront properties. In this film, it is warm and sunny (except for some scenes where bad weather symbolizes crisis to promote the movie’s climax) and for that reason, we recommend spending a frigid February evening or wintery weekend afternoon in the theatre. Take a little vacation to the coast with this piece of cinema.<br />

<p>4. It’s grown-up. The Choice carries with it mature and complex themes. It’s not just a love story, it makes some philosophical and morale claims, as well. Viewers will notice a voice-over narrative about choices and life’s direction. They’ll also find religious undertones and implications about the importance of tradition and the value of family, and it will be impossible to ignore the blatant message: “Love harder.” So, if you’re not in the mood for a chick flick, step up to the ticket window anyway. This movie offers more than just the cliché tropes of a romantic drama.</p>
<p>Overall, we enjoyed the film. While it does not receive rave reviews from other entertainment reporters, we found The Choice to be more than what we expected and rate it a good choice for Valentine’s viewing. (Note: We do not recommend this as a choice for a first date. There will be crying, and if you’re uncomfortable with showing emotion as your friendship forms, skip this one. Besides, is there any good way to warn your date that she might need to wear waterproof mascara when she goes out with you? That might sound like a bad omen. And is it really fair to ask her to cry off all of her concealer, like we did? I mean, she barely knows you! She probably isn’t ready to bare her whole heart and her naked face, too.)</p>The post <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/2016/02/is-the-choice-the-best-choice-for-valentines-day/">Is The Choice the best choice for Valentine’s Day?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/2016/01/being-a-writer-atmospheric-pressure/">Being A Writer : Atmospheric Pressure</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I write the saddest lines.</p>
<p>Wait. That’s been said. And, my, Pablo Neruda could say it, couldn’t he? (Shew!)</p>
<p>… but there is no atmosphere in this winter, and so I can’t write the saddest lines. I have trouble writing any lines at all. Rain has fallen for over a week. The ground is spongy, and the creek banks are littered with long grasses and driftwood brought downstream by gully-washers. Temperatures have been record high, but the sun hasn’t shone in … a very long time. The whimsy of the season is absent. The gloomy weather doesn’t even induce melancholy; it’s just dull.</p>
<p>At this time of year &#8212; when days are short, but nights still don’t seem long enough to rejuvenate the exhausted soul &#8212; a writer like me needs slow snow fall out the window, and the twinkle of white Christmas tree lights in the reflection of the window near the big writing desk. She needs steaming coffee and music – real music played by clever songwriters on real instruments.</p>
<p>A fireplace might be nice, too, but it’s not essential.</p>
<p>This winter, the precipitation is coming down in buckets, not in flakes, and the fireplace is waiting for me to switch the air-conditioning off again. Thus, the desired writing ambiance is lacking.</p>
<p>Sure, one could concoct a musey-mood elsewhere, I suppose. Sometimes it is easier to achieve an inspirational atmosphere by writing in a public place such as a coffee shop, bustling hotel lobby, or transit station. These places help the writer disappear, or to step outside of who he or she is. For me, I must step outside of who I am to others. The right atmosphere help me achieve that, to a point.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why there is a restlessness inside of me – a gypsy undercurrent that sometimes tempts me to be absent from my workplace, out of the kitchen, away from the home, released to the highway. The writer in me wants to roam and see and listen and feel and think and roll. I don’t get to do that often, but it seems that when there are wheels under me, my writer heart is happiest.</p>
<p>… but roaming requires time, money, and opportunity. For me, it would be a selfish investment. I am a full-time professional with a family, and like many writers with day jobs, I find myself saying, “I can write when I take time off work/when the chores are finished/when the kids go to college/when I retire …” This is not realistic. Life will always be busy, and writers write, so we must prioritize. I must prioritize.</p>
<p>In an earlier issue of Relatively Random we discussed the things that writers need: invitation, community, and outlet. We reviewed resources that provide invitations for writers, but without community, the equation is incomplete. Writers write, but they don’t do it alone; it is not the solitary business some people imagine it is. Writers need other writers to hold them celebrate with them, inspire them, and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>For 2016, I plan to reimagine my writing community. Within a new community of writers, I will find the balance between life and the writing life. I invite you to join me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna looked behind her in the rearview mirror, but they had already vanished into the house. She could recall all of her previous leavings &#8212; leaving her grandparents after a Sunday meal, leaving her best friend&#8217;s house across the street, leaving for college &#8212; all of these departures, no matter how trivial, how brief the separation, how long the journey ahead, her leaving was always commemorated with a figure in the doorway or on the front porch, steadfast, waving and smiling and growing smaller in the distance as her leaving pulled her farther away. This time, her husband and children had quickly slipped inside the dark of the house, retreating to watch the game, before her tires had slowed to a stop at the end of their driveway.</p>

The especially rainy summer helped the trees hold their leaves a little longer and shine their colors a whole lot brighter. Anna found the first-turning tree on the mountain remarkable. She wished she could be that tree &#8212; prime, unafraid to burst into passionate color and strip herself all the way down, to be scarlet on green like fire in late summer, like flush on the still-golden skin of soybean fields. Brave. Gorgeous. Bold. Surrendering.</p>
<p>The chime of her turn signal interrupted her fantasy. Right. Right. Right. Right, it commanded. She flashed a glance to the mirror again. Nobody. Nothing.</p>
<p>Right. Right. Right. Go right. Do right. Live right.</p>
<p>The universe chanted, pounding in her head. Pressure squeezed her chest. Her mouth felt dry. She swallowed hard and jerked the wheel left.</p>The post <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/2015/11/journey/">Journey</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdeats.github.io/relatively-random/">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
