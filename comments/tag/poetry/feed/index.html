										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She’s an old rocker<br />
And that’s still how she rolls<br />
The music still moves her<br />
Right down to her soul</p>
<p>She’s no longer pretty<br />
In leather and lace<br />
And now there are wrinkles<br />
That cover her face</p>
<p>She leans on the stage<br />
And she rocks back and forth<br />
Her body’s gone south<br />
As her age has gone north</p>
<p>But despite all of that<br />
She is glad just to be<br />
So close to the man<br />
She has come here to see</p>
<p>Cause he’s an old rocker<br />
And that’s how he still rolls<br />
And the music’s his life<br />
Not for riches he toils</p>
<p>His figure has changed some<br />
He’s stooped and he’s bent<br />
But he still has the magic<br />
His gift, heaven-sent</p>
<p>He sees her before him<br />
And he smiles to himself<br />
They are two of a kind<br />
Both fooling themselves</p>
<p>Their days now are numbered<br />
And their night won’t be long<br />
But here it’s still evening<br />
And this still is her song</p>The post <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/2017/03/rocker/">Rocker</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a day designed by hate<br />
The goal to crush and maim<br />
Those lacking understanding<br />
Seeking someone to blame</p>
<p>I remember the fear rising<br />
As the towers were laid low<br />
Watching dust ghosts wandering<br />
Not knowing where to go</p>
<p>Then came those to the rescue<br />
Calling sirens and flashing lights<br />
Their bravery unquestioned<br />
Charging through the day turned night</p>
<p>Their strength was a great comfort<br />
Heroes tried and true<br />
They were NY&#8217;s Finest<br />
FDNY and NYPD too</p>
<p>Through the rubble and destruction<br />
Loved ones lost were saved or found<br />
We even raised our colors<br />
Our hearts together tightly bound</p>
<p>Though the purpose of those men<br />
was to divide us in our fear<br />
What happened was a testament<br />
to this nation we hold dear</p>
<p>We stopped looking at our neighbor<br />
through a lens of us and them<br />
We stood united, brought together<br />
by our prayers and helping hands</p>
<p>It was a lesson unintended<br />
by those who sought to bring us down<br />
And one we&#8217;ve since forgotten<br />
With no blood to soak the ground</p>
<p>But on this day we remember<br />
What it means to stand as one<br />
Unencumbered by our labels<br />
Proud to be American</p>The post <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/2016/09/american-scar/">American Scar</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not what you expect<br />
Or even what you don&#8217;t<br />
It&#8217;s what you never thought possible<br />
That can sway your hope</p>
<p>The moments you imagined<br />
Seem far brighter in your mind<br />
And only seem to sharpen<br />
As reality fades with time</p>
<p>What was is always better<br />
What is just isn&#8217;t enough<br />
Shadows of possibility<br />
At first tender end up being tough</p>
<p>The moment so elusive<br />
Slips easily through our grasp<br />
We missed it in life&#8217;s struggle<br />
And reflect with our last gasp</p>The post <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/2016/07/perspective/">Perspective</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the upstairs bathroom,<br />
I practiced with paint &#8212;<br />
eyes, cheeks, lips.</p>
<p>The New York summer<br />
dragged on, humid and misty.</p>
<p>Cousin&#8217;s grunge bands<br />
jammed out the angst we all felt<br />
in those days</p>
<p>Below, in my uncle&#8217;s driveway,<br />
tools beat a rhythm of freedom.<a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/braids-n-beltloops.jpg" rel="lightbox[1759]"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1763" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/braids-n-beltloops.jpg" alt="braids-n-beltloops" width="467" height="555" srcset="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/braids-n-beltloops.jpg 642w, https://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/braids-n-beltloops-252x300.jpg 252w, https://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/braids-n-beltloops-330x392.jpg 330w, https://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/braids-n-beltloops-488x580.jpg 488w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></a><br />
I knew the words to your song instinctively.</p>
<p>Your anthem pulled me to the window   .<br />
You had your head in the engine of a GMC.<br />
Your hands, young, but capable<br />
manipulated horsepower and torque<br />
and the promise of the American highway.</p>
<p>I could feel the heat of your body<br />
rise<br />
two stories up&#8211;<br />
steam through cotton.</p>
<p>The universe told me what to do,<br />
but I turned back to my reflection,<br />
tamed my wildness into a prim braid,<br />
blotted my lip gloss<br />
and only thought about<br />
slipping my fingers<br />
through your belt loops<br />
and turning you around to face me.</p>The post <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/2016/07/heat/">Heat</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

at the ballgame<br />
At the frosty freeze.</p>
<p>He is bumbling. Clumsy.<br />
He is awkward. Unmannerly.</p>

It&#8217;s just you, Mother, and your boy.</p>
<p>You begin.</p>
<p>You tell him of the boys you remember,<br />
of how she&#8217;ll never forget the ones who were mean,<br />
of how she&#8217;ll never forget the ones who were not.</p>
<p>You wink. Confessing.</p>
<p>He sees you now.<br />
Different.</p>
<p>He cranes his neck, forcing his face to the passenger side glass<br />
and as the family wagon rolls on,<br />
your right hand on his shoulder,<br />
you know there are tears.</p>The post <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/2016/05/a-change/">A Change</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When his name was announced<br />
What the silence pronounced<br />
Was the soul of the Sabbath Day crowd</p>
<p>They had come here to see<br />
The last game he would be<br />
In the uniform he wore so proud</p>
<p>He had played twenty years<br />
Through the boos and the cheers<br />
With a thirst, and a love for the game</p>
<p>He would send them away<br />
Filled with awe and dismay<br />
They could see what had earned him his fame</p>
<p>When he’d step to the plate<br />
How his chest would inflate<br />
With the crowd like the wind at his back</p>
<p>He knew what to do<br />
With whatever they threw<br />
When to take, when to give it a whack</p>
<p>He would focus his eyes<br />
His selection was wise<br />
There was steel in his arms when he swung</p>
<p>They were drawn to this place<br />
To watch his style and grace<br />
When they rose it was his praise was sung</p>
<p>This was his church, it’s true<br />
And you sat is his pew<br />
When you came out to watch this man play</p>
<p>He was surely to blame<br />
This was more than a game<br />
What spit had been mixed with his clay?</p>
<p>He had played 20 years<br />
And had earned every cheer<br />
In his mind he still had his youth</p>
<p>But the young hurlers knew<br />
By the pitches they threw<br />
That his body was feeling the truth</p>
<p>Here he’d dove for a ball<br />
There he’d run in the wall<br />
He’d been pitched at, he’d slid hard, he’d run</p>
<p>When his legs were too sore<br />
When his ligaments tore<br />
Still he played, till the season was done</p>
<p>Now he stood at the plate<br />
Contemplating his fate<br />
As the pitcher stood staring him down</p>
<p>“Don’t worry old bum”<br />
Boldly these words had come<br />
From the catcher, who spat on the ground</p>
<p>“It isn’t my call<br />
But he’ll throw you four balls<br />
That’s the way that they want it today.</p>
<p>You are big in this town<br />
But I think you’re a clown<br />
It’s a disgrace they still let you play”</p>
<p>As he walked down to first<br />
He remembered the thirst<br />
That he always had had for this game</p>
<p>Although out of respect<br />
A walk didn’t reflect<br />
Why they’d come here to honor his name</p>
<p>But he’d no time to stew<br />
The next drive went on through<br />
To the wall and he started to run</p>
<p>As past second he ran<br />
He caught sight of the man<br />
Out in center, “man he’s got a gun”</p>
<p>But he bobbled the ball<br />
Played it bad off the wall<br />
And he’d been here often before</p>
<p>He would challenge the play<br />
And he’d make that man pay<br />
If they waved him on in he would score</p>
<p>Once he ran like the wind<br />
Now the legs would not bend<br />
Still he gave it the best that he had</p>
<p>When he rounded third base<br />
You could see in his face<br />
The fervor he had as a lad</p>
<p>As the coach waves him in<br />
He’s urged on by the din<br />
But too late he knows with a gasp</p>
<p>With his spirit strong<br />
He’d excited the throng<br />
But his reach had exceeded his grasp</p>
<p>These last months that he’d spent<br />
On the bench to repent<br />
For his failings brought on by his age</p>
<p>Had prepared him to fail<br />
Striving to no avail<br />
But his heart was igniting a rage</p>
<p>He had not played this long<br />
To have this his swan song<br />
To be mocked by that boy at the plate</p>
<p>They were blocking him wide<br />
Trying to force a slide<br />
Just in case that the ball got there late</p>
<p>They knew with his knee<br />
It’s the wrong place to be<br />
He would have to reach back with his hand</p>
<p>The tag, they were sure<br />
The out would insure<br />
His hourglass was now out of sand</p>
<p>The catcher reached out<br />
For the ball as a shout<br />
From the crowd said they knew he was done</p>
<p>He’d given his best<br />
But he’d failed this last test<br />
He would never deliver this run</p>
<p>He could feel the knee give<br />
And his reason to live<br />
Would be gone when the ump made his call</p>
<p>It was anguish he felt<br />
As hope started to melt<br />
When he heard the loud ‘pop’ of the ball</p>
<p>There guarding the plate<br />
Like St. Peter’s gate<br />
Stood the catcher a sneer on his face</p>
<p>“Old man you’ve had your day<br />
Now it’s your time to pay<br />
You’re too old to handle the pace”</p>
<p>He could not hear the crowd<br />
For his heart beat too loud<br />
As for one final slide he prepared</p>
<p>The catcher bent down<br />
His plight to compound<br />
The ump stooped to see how he fared</p>
<p>He’d be stripped of his pride<br />
At the end of this slide<br />
His career would end in defeat</p>
<p>With the last of his strength<br />
He extended full length<br />
And his dive tore his foe from his feet</p>
<p>The crowd stood to a man<br />
Now one unified fan<br />
And their roar his salvation pronounced</p>
<p>The umps arms spread wide<br />
The catcher lay on his side<br />
And grabbed for the ball as it bounced</p>
<p>Slowly he rose<br />
There was blood on his nose<br />
And the pain in his knee was intense</p>
<p>He should have been proud<br />
As he waved to the crowd<br />
His legacy now was immense</p>
<p>But the man simply turned<br />
To the catcher who’d spurned<br />
This ancient, decrepit old man</p>
<p>For a moment he gazed<br />
At the hand that was raised<br />
With their shake they said all a man can</p>
<p>His career now was through<br />
To this game he’d been true<br />
For his sins he’d atoned here today</p>
<p>They were still in their seats<br />
In reverence of this feat<br />
By the man they had come to watch play</p>
<p>His teammates just stood<br />
For they felt that they should<br />
Let him walk all alone from the field</p>
<p>This game takes its toll<br />
Here he’d given his soul<br />
His redemption, refusing to yield</p>The post <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/2016/04/the-deacon/">The Deacon</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
