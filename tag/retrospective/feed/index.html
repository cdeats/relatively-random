										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the dawn’s early light<br />
Came the end of the night<br />
Where his demons had ransacked his soul</p>
<p>He had slept between screams<br />
He’d let loose in his dreams<br />
To awake and escape was his goal</p>
<p>All alone on his bench<br />
Still immersed in the stench<br />
Of the bottle he clutched to his chest</p>
<p>The night terrors replaced<br />
By the panic he faced<br />
Every day, it would yield him no rest</p>
<p>For his raiment, distressed<br />
His harsh life now confessed<br />
Here was evidence true of despair</p>
<p>Now untouched as he lay<br />
By the hope of this day<br />
Or the smell of the crisp harbor air</p>
<p>Busy souls passed him by<br />
And he started to cry<br />
Without tears, for they’d left long ago</p>
<p>With a purposeful stride<br />
The living now passed his side<br />
Without casting a thought towards his woe</p>
<p>For the bed that he’d made<br />
The park service had paid<br />
It was here that he spent his night hours</p>
<p>As if by some inner voice<br />
Had said “make this your choice”<br />
In the shadow of these matching towers</p>
<p>Though the bustle by day<br />
Would soon drive him away<br />
To continue pursuit without cause</p>
<p>But on this autumn day<br />
Some strange force made him stay<br />
Though at risk of the vagrancy laws</p>
<p>He sat up, gazed his eyes<br />
Where the twin buildings rise<br />
Towards the skies in a jubilant thrust</p>
<p>They are symbols of power<br />
Free enterprise’s true flower<br />
More than that, they are beacons of trust</p>
<p>Their proud glass now reflects<br />
What their culture protects<br />
The fond dreams of a world he can’t fit<br />
There is pain in his heart<br />
As he makes to depart<br />
But again, some strange urge makes him sit</p>
<p>As the workers stream in<br />
Unaware of their sin<br />
In his mind, through his fog, he can see</p>
<p>Life’s a choice, not a gift<br />
He has chosen to drift<br />
They have chosen instead to be free</p>
<p>By their toil every day<br />
They continue to pay<br />
For the choices that he couldn’t make</p>
<p>It is their love of life<br />
That girds them for the strife<br />
These shafts hold the chances they take</p>
<p>In pursuit of a dream<br />
Every girder and beam<br />
Were erected, an idol to hope</p>
<p>They reflect by their size,<br />
The grandeur of their rise,<br />
The enormity of freedom’s scope</p>
<p>Now he shrivels inside<br />
This man, stripped of his pride<br />
And reflects on his failures, his past<br />
As he sits so engrossed<br />
Staring up at his host<br />
He could not be prepared for the blast</p>
<p>By the full light of dawn<br />
His attention is drawn<br />
To a missile inbound on its prey</p>
<p>The impact is loud<br />
And the screams of the crowd<br />
Set the tone that will play out this day</p>
<p>In the din and the smoke<br />
A soul suddenly awoke<br />
And the husk of a man stands erect</p>
<p>As if learning anew<br />
What a man ought to do<br />
He starts slow, but his path is direct</p>
<p>The shatter of glass<br />
That succumbs to the mass<br />
Of the building no longer intact</p>
<p>Overshadows the sound<br />
As his bottle hits ground<br />
And at last he is free to react</p>
<p>One witness speaks<br />
Of a man of the streets<br />
Walking into that pillar of fire<br />
Of the look on his face<br />
How he shed his disgrace<br />
Sacrificing despair for desire</p>
<p>The onlookers saw<br />
Him succumb to the law<br />
Of survival, but more, of intent</p>
<p>He carried the fight<br />
For persistence of right<br />
By his actions his sins were repent</p>
<p>The stories are told<br />
Of a man who was bold<br />
Through the smoke he would drift like a ghost</p>
<p>He was seen on the stair<br />
The dust covered his hair<br />
Carrying someone who needed it most</p>
<p>He’d hand off each in turn<br />
Slip away, then return<br />
With another limp form on his back</p>
<p>Then at once came the sound<br />
And the force shook the ground<br />
As the steel of the girders went slack</p>
<p>The eclipse of the sun<br />
As the world came undone<br />
Was it dust or the vapor of hope<br />
As the structure collapsed<br />
Freedom’s hold was relaxed<br />
There were things with which it couldn’t cope</p>
<p>In the days that would come<br />
Folks would tally the sum<br />
Of the courage expended that day</p>
<p>They would talk of the men<br />
Whose lives came to an end<br />
And we never may know where they lay</p>
<p>But unnoticed by all<br />
Who were caught in the maul<br />
Of this monstrously evil display</p>
<p>Not caught on any tape<br />
Sat a lone ashen shape<br />
On the bench where he’d started his day</p>The post <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com/2015/09/depth-on-the-bench/">Depth On The Bench</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
