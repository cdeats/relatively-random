										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Super Bowl is an American tradition fifty years strong this year, and we at Relatively Random anticipated this season&#8217;s pinnacle display like many other Americans. We love it for the athletic competition, the strategy, the entertainment, and&#8230; the commercials. This year, our favorite advertisements include&#8230;</span></p>
<p><strong><br />
The Bearded Writer’s Choice &#8211; Death Wish Coffee</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After commercials for Marvel superheroes littered my screen for several hours, I was excited to see a new movie that had a less cartoonish feel. Ok, well maybe Vikings sailing gleefully to their afterlife in Valhalla is still a touch on the caricature side. Still, I was enthralled. And then I was even more excited. Caffeinated you might say. The Deathwish Coffee commercial was easily my favorite.  I may buy some, if for no other reason than the hope it may help my ginger beard reach epic lengths. Oh wait&#8230;Grandma always told me strong coffee would put hair on my chest&#8230;..beard dreams crushed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commercial is still funny.   Take a look. </span></p>

<p><strong><br />
The Car Enthusiast’s Choice &#8211; Audi R8 </strong></p>
<p>So, I’ll admit it, I’m a car guy.  There are very few things that bring a smile to my face faster than the smell of a new car interior, the sound of a finely tuned exhaust, the feeling of being glued to my seat as a car launches from a dead stop to triple digits in a fraction of a minute.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audi was able to bring that same smile to my face with their Super Bowl 50 television spot, and here are 209 reasons to love the new Audi R8 Commercial&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason 1… It takes us back to the awe and pride of the early adventures into outer space…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason 2… It reminds us that sometimes, all we need is a link to the past to wake us in the present…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason 3… It plants the seed that a car, not just any car, but a German built Supercar, with ten fire breathing cylinders packed directly behind the front seats, that comes to life with a push of a button, will fill us with the same exhilaration and excitement that only an astronaut experiences when a rocket takes off from the launch pad, destined for space&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason 4… &#8230;If the first three are not reason enough, it’s all placed to the soundtrack of David Bowie’s “Starman”&#8230;a fitting tribute to the music legend that left our planet far too soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasons 205-209… The Audi R8 will reach a top speed of 205 MPH&#8230;.and Audi is not afraid to highlight that in a television commercial… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you missed it, check it out here&#8230;</span></p>

<p><strong><br />
A Staff Favorite &#8211; Honda Ridgeline</strong></p>
<p>How can ‘ewe’ not love a pasture full of barnyard animals singing Queen’s &#8220;Somebody to Love&#8221;.   That kind of thing may make some a bit sheepish, but you can’t pull the wool over our eyes, that was a great commercial.  Yeah, the new Honda Ridgeline looks like it has some nice features, but we think the sheep were the stars of this television spot.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a look for yourself&#8230;</span></p>
