<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>They smelled
the bubblegum the moment they burst into the small shop on the corner, the
wheels on their bikes still spinning where they came to rest after the two
young boys leapt from them at full speed, and the shop door not yet having had
time to slam shut behind them.&nbsp; No
wonder. The shop owner, knowing his customer base, had stacked the new shipment
of Topps baseball card packages on a small table just to the right of the door
where the afternoon sun beating through the window would heat up the packages,
releasing the irresistible aroma.</p>



<p>It was
spring, and the season was just about to get started.&nbsp; The boys had saved their snow-shoveling money
all winter in preparation for this moment.&nbsp;
They were the first in the shop, easily out-distancing the other town
boys who would be arriving on foot.&nbsp; That
meant that they would be able to select first from the neat stacks of cards,
five to a package plus the gum, for a nickel a pack.&nbsp; The gum was not very good, or at least not
for very long. And it was usually hard and became less and less pliable as the
season wore on, as enough stock to supply a shop of this size for the entire
season could easily be ordered all at once.&nbsp;
But today it would be at its freshest.</p>



<p>But it was
not the bubblegum that was the object of the boys’ eagerness.&nbsp; It was the cards.&nbsp; Each package contained the hope of a Yankee
card, or even more than one.&nbsp; There were
other cards that held some mild interest, and the rest were valuable currency
for trades or fodder for games of closest to the wall or flipping. But it was
the Yankee cards that were the real prize.&nbsp;
Each of those cards contained a picture of some Yankee, starter, reserve
or prospect, while the back of the card contained his pedigree.&nbsp; These were the player’s stats, figures that
would be memorized, discussed and argued over endlessly, and went a long way
towards determining which player a person would “call” before pickup games
commenced.&nbsp; There was an art to calling your
player, at just the exact moment, so you could pretend to be him during the
game.&nbsp; You could not call too early, as
that was unsportsmanlike, but if you waited until someone started the bidding
you ran the risk of losing out on your first choice.&nbsp; The timing was tricky, but everyone knew when
bidding opened instinctively.&nbsp; You just
had to not jump the gun.</p>



<p>Any Yankee
card was a win, and if you bought five packs and got even a single Yankee you
had had yourself a good day.&nbsp; But the
ultimate prize was number seven.&nbsp; No
matter what position you played, your favorite player was number seven, and you
wanted to be him, and so you tried to time your “call” so that you could take
on his persona, if only for a game.&nbsp; If
that happened, you had had a very good day indeed.</p>



<p>Today, the
young warrior and The Great Chief were not warriors.&nbsp; It was the start of the season and they were
now baseball players.&nbsp; It was as such
that they were sitting on the curb outside the shop, too-large Yankee caps on
their heads, opening their card packs when the rest of the boys arrived,
panting from having run all the way from the school.&nbsp; The other boys looked enviously at the two
brothers, some standing over them half resentful, half curious, anxious to see
what players they had gotten.&nbsp; Others
pushed eagerly on into the store, still hoping that getting to select early
would bring them luck.</p>



<p>As it turned
out, there was luck to be had that day.&nbsp;
Each of the brothers had scored two Yankees apiece.&nbsp; Neither of them, however, had been lucky
enough to get a number seven.&nbsp; Bobby Richardson,
Moose Skowron, Ralph Terry, and Hector Lopez.&nbsp;
No Whitey Ford.&nbsp; No Mickey
Mantle.&nbsp; The younger brother was happy
because he had Bobby Richardson, his second favorite player, and a fellow
second-baseman.&nbsp; He would later come to
embrace Moose Skowron, as his future coach, making light of his slender build
and diminutive stature would saddle him with the nickname “Moose”.&nbsp; But for now, it was Bobby Richardson.&nbsp; The older brother was not overly thrilled
with his take, but he was philosophical.&nbsp;
It was the first of many packs to be opened.&nbsp; If not by him, then by one of the other boys
for whom money was not so much of an issue and who did not possess his skill at
flipping cards.&nbsp; He was particularly
adept at this and knew how to shame other boys into anteing up some of their
more valuable cards.&nbsp; He wasn’t worried.</p>



<p>And then it
happened.&nbsp; One of the other boys opened a
pack and there at the top, a slight smudge of bubblegum coating covering the
place where his bat met his shoulder, was the serious, purposeful likeness of
number seven.&nbsp; Mickey Mantle.</p>



<p>The
gathering of boys fell briefly silent, as if in reverence, and then
erupted.&nbsp; Inside the shopkeeper grinned
to himself.&nbsp; He had them now. Outside the
boys, took turns pounding the lucky lad on his back and congratulated him,
called him every kind of name they could think of with “lucky” in the title,
and then one by one slunk off to nurse their disappointment.&nbsp; It should have been them.</p>



<p>The pecking
order was now established.&nbsp; The boy with
the Mickey Mantle card would get to choose first when picking sides for games
on the little league field behind the school.&nbsp;
His opinion on matters of player superiority would suddenly have more
weight, and he would be deferred to in various other matters where validity was
a matter of preference.&nbsp; At least until
someone else was able to land a number seven.&nbsp;
In the mean-time a period of reverence would be observed before bidding
would begin in earnest to try to wrest the card away from him by offering any
number of lesser players, some later to be Hall of Famers in their own right,
as well as other treasures like old baseballs whose covers were not yet
starting to come off, or a bat that only needed to be glued and wrapped but not
screwed in order to continue functioning. Usually a week was sufficient.&nbsp; But being as this was the beginning of the
season, it would be surprising if that level of patience could be maintained.</p>



<p>As it
happened, the week was not yet up when the younger brother was to face his
greatest struggle.&nbsp; It was to be a
galvanizing moment in his life.&nbsp; He would
face other challenges.&nbsp; He would be
tested again and again over the course of his life, but none would compare to
this.&nbsp; Time would be marked from this
moment onward.</p>



<p>It happened
at recess.&nbsp; The boy, now commonly
referred to as Number Seven, was showing off his baseball card collection to a
circle of rapt fellow graders.&nbsp; His
father was someone of note in the town and the family had money.&nbsp; That meant that Number Seven was able to
procure numerous packs of baseball cards.&nbsp;
More than anyone else.&nbsp; He had
managed to acquire several other Yankee cards, including the team card so he
had not one but two cards with Mickey Mantle on them.&nbsp; He had spread the cards out on the grass for
inspection and was happily absorbing the envy of his classmates when the bell
rang, signaling the end of recess.&nbsp; The
other boys sprinted away, leaving him to collect up his cards alone.&nbsp; This he did hastily and started half walking
half running towards the school.&nbsp; The
youngest brother, who had lagged behind for a last yearning look at the Mantle
card, followed close behind at a jog.&nbsp;
When it happened it was unexpected.&nbsp;
A card dropped from the pile Number Seven was clutching awkwardly and
drifted lazily to the ground in his wake.&nbsp;
The younger brother stopped, scooped up the card and started jogging
after the boy.&nbsp; He glanced casually at
the card and stopped in mid stride.&nbsp; It
was the Mantle card.&nbsp; He took a couple
tentative steps towards the boy, stopped and started again.&nbsp; They were now perilously close to the school
door where Miss Helga stood like St Peter, guarding the gate.&nbsp; The younger brother was awash with
conflicting emotions.&nbsp; There was no time
to resolve them, so he did the only thing he could possibly do under the
circumstances.&nbsp; He slipped the card into
his front pants pocket and walked gingerly into the school, trying hard not to
bend his leg too much and damage the card.&nbsp;
Miss Helga looked suspiciously at him as he passed by her, but then she
always seemed to.</p>



<p>The ride home
from school was even slower than usual.&nbsp;
The older brother did not complain, as his breathing was becoming more
and more forced these days.&nbsp; If he
thought it odd, he did not show it. The younger brother rode behind and pedaled
primarily with his left leg, letting his right leg dangle as much as
possible.&nbsp; He was afraid to take the card
out of his pocket for any reason and would not trust it to leave his person in
any event.&nbsp; You do not trust the Crown
Jewels out of your sight, or at least out of your pocket.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The younger
brother was torn.&nbsp; He wanted desperately
to share his dilemma with his older, wiser brother, but he was afraid that he
would not like the advice he would receive, nor the disapproval that would
inevitably accompany it, because he knew in his heart of hearts that he was not
capable of following it.&nbsp; Knowing the
right thing to do is seldom the comfort that one hopes.</p>



<p>There was a
tiny nook in the attic behind the chimney that you had to reach your hand in
and around to get to that he was sure even his older brother was unaware
of.&nbsp; He had used this in the past on a
couple of occasions, like once when Betsy whose last name he could never
remember had given him a valentine that said things he didn’t want anyone to
see.&nbsp; He somehow didn’t want to throw it
out either, so there was nothing else to do but hide it.&nbsp; It was a printed valentine from the same box
everyone’s parents bought them to hand out at school, but she had added “hope
you have a happy valentine’s day” on the back in block letters and had signed
it in cursive.&nbsp; Perhaps he read more
sentiment into it than the sender had intended, but it was still too
embarrassing to be seen by others, so he hid it.&nbsp; His brother was busy in the bathroom for a
moment, so he took advantage of the brief moment of separation and hid the
Mantle card there and returned quickly before anyone noticed his absence.&nbsp; He would find several opportunities to return
here again, with a flashlight, so as to assure himself the poisoned fruit was
still there.</p>



<p>It was not until two days later that the loss of the Mantle
card was discovered.&nbsp; Number Seven, who
technically no longer warranted the title, had made additional purchases and
was eager to show the boys his new Elston Howard card.&nbsp; The tiny community was somehow unaware that
there was a race issue in the country, so that card was cherished as well as
any other.&nbsp; More so now that he was the
regular catcher.&nbsp; It was in the spreading
out of his cards on the grass as per usual that the loss of the Mantle card was
discovered.&nbsp; Frantically the pile of
cards was searched and searched again to no avail.&nbsp; The card was gone.&nbsp; There was an uncomfortable hush over the
multitude not witnessed since the funeral of the alternate town drunk.&nbsp; The boys had not wanted to be at that funeral
and they did not want to be here now.&nbsp; It
was that kind of moment.&nbsp; The younger
brother began to sweat.&nbsp; He never sweat.
Some of the others looked like they were fighting back tears.&nbsp; It was a community loss.&nbsp; It was the only Mantle card known to exist in
their whole world.&nbsp; The older brother
looked puzzled as he glanced at his sibling, but he did not say anything.&nbsp; As usual, he took this in stride, much as he
took everything else.&nbsp; “It will turn up”,
someone said, and then the floodgates were open, and everyone chimed in with
suggestions of where it might have been left and how it would be no time until
he found it.&nbsp; This was followed with
another search of all Number Seven’s books and jacket pockets etc.&nbsp; Suddenly someone noticed what looked like
tiny traces of shredded cardboard on the freshly mown grass.&nbsp; There was a unified audible gasp.&nbsp; All but one gasped in horror.&nbsp; One gasped in relief.&nbsp; It was clear what had happened.&nbsp; Each shard of cardboard was examined, and
some felt they saw what looked like traces of the Mick’s face.&nbsp; Others thought they saw writing that could
have been the stats.&nbsp; It was very hard to
do accurate forensics.&nbsp; There was too
much damage.&nbsp; There was no consoling
Number Seven who was understandably still in denial.&nbsp; No amount of sympathy would help, and empathy
was impossible.&nbsp; No one had ever
experienced a loss of that magnitude.&nbsp;
Even reassurances that Number Seven could retain his title did little to
console him.&nbsp; At last the bell rang and
as a group they slouched back into the school, past a waiting Miss Helga, who
almost looked happy.</p>



<p>For the days
that followed, the younger brother at first seemed to become less somber, but
then became more and more self-absorbed. He did not eat well and seemed less
interested in things.&nbsp; His older brother
noticed but did not comment. His parents were dealing with issues of their own
and it didn’t register with them, or perhaps they were just enjoying the
reduction in barometric pressure and didn’t want to do anything to disturb the
less frenetic atmosphere.</p>



<p>It was two
weeks later that Number Seven once again found the courage to display his
cards.&nbsp; He had purchased several packs
one day and had gotten three more Yankees, only one a duplicate.&nbsp; These he displayed proudly on the grass.&nbsp; The bidding for the duplicate was hot and
heavy but ultimately no agreement could be reached.&nbsp; When the bell rang, the younger brother
stayed behind to help him pick up and walked with him back to class, his step
lighter than it had been in weeks.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Buoyed up by
his recent luck, Number Seven again made purchases at the corner shop, and
again he scored a new Yankee card.&nbsp; As
usual the group was convened at recess the next day to show off the new Johnny
Blanchard card.&nbsp; When he spread out the
cards, there were a couple of Baltimore Oriol cards mixed in with the Yankee
cards.&nbsp; When he moved them out of the
way, his hand stopped suddenly in midair.&nbsp;
There beneath the Brooks Robinson card was the Mantle Card.&nbsp; “Well I’ll Be” was all he said.&nbsp; There was much back pounding and excited
chatter and I told you so’s.&nbsp; </p>



<p>When the
bell sounded, the group brushing past Miss Helga was completely impervious to
her usual demands for proper decorum when entering the school.&nbsp; The world was back on its axis.</p>



<p>On the trip home the younger brother
rode ahead of his older sibling, circling and coming back only to ride ahead
again, over and over.&nbsp; He did wheelies
and slides and generally acted like a colt kicking up its heels.&nbsp; As they neared the house, his older brother,
clearly winded, looked him in the eye and simply asked, “When did you decide to
give it back?”</p>



<p><em>Four
years later the two boys would be sitting in the front row of the right field
bleachers in Yankee Stadium with their oldest brother, looking down at a man
wearing the number 7 on his pinstriped uniform.&nbsp;
It would be the first and only time they would ever see him play.&nbsp; It is customary when asked to divulge the
happiest moment of your life to respond by mentioning your wedding day or the
birth of your child…and perhaps that is so.</em></p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2020/03/number-7/">Number 7</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When his name was announced<br />
What the silence pronounced<br />
Was the soul of the Sabbath Day crowd</p>
<p>They had come here to see<br />
The last game he would be<br />
In the uniform he wore so proud</p>
<p>He had played twenty years<br />
Through the boos and the cheers<br />
With a thirst, and a love for the game</p>
<p>He would send them away<br />
Filled with awe and dismay<br />
They could see what had earned him his fame</p>
<p>When he’d step to the plate<br />
How his chest would inflate<br />
With the crowd like the wind at his back</p>
<p>He knew what to do<br />
With whatever they threw<br />
When to take, when to give it a whack</p>
<p>He would focus his eyes<br />
His selection was wise<br />
There was steel in his arms when he swung</p>
<p>They were drawn to this place<br />
To watch his style and grace<br />
When they rose it was his praise was sung</p>
<p>This was his church, it’s true<br />
And you sat is his pew<br />
When you came out to watch this man play</p>
<p>He was surely to blame<br />
This was more than a game<br />
What spit had been mixed with his clay?</p>
<p>He had played 20 years<br />
And had earned every cheer<br />
In his mind he still had his youth</p>
<p>But the young hurlers knew<br />
By the pitches they threw<br />
That his body was feeling the truth</p>
<p>Here he’d dove for a ball<br />
There he’d run in the wall<br />
He’d been pitched at, he’d slid hard, he’d run</p>
<p>When his legs were too sore<br />
When his ligaments tore<br />
Still he played, till the season was done</p>
<p>Now he stood at the plate<br />
Contemplating his fate<br />
As the pitcher stood staring him down</p>
<p>“Don’t worry old bum”<br />
Boldly these words had come<br />
From the catcher, who spat on the ground</p>
<p>“It isn’t my call<br />
But he’ll throw you four balls<br />
That’s the way that they want it today.</p>
<p>You are big in this town<br />
But I think you’re a clown<br />
It’s a disgrace they still let you play”</p>
<p>As he walked down to first<br />
He remembered the thirst<br />
That he always had had for this game</p>
<p>Although out of respect<br />
A walk didn’t reflect<br />
Why they’d come here to honor his name</p>
<p>But he’d no time to stew<br />
The next drive went on through<br />
To the wall and he started to run</p>
<p>As past second he ran<br />
He caught sight of the man<br />
Out in center, “man he’s got a gun”</p>
<p>But he bobbled the ball<br />
Played it bad off the wall<br />
And he’d been here often before</p>
<p>He would challenge the play<br />
And he’d make that man pay<br />
If they waved him on in he would score</p>
<p>Once he ran like the wind<br />
Now the legs would not bend<br />
Still he gave it the best that he had</p>
<p>When he rounded third base<br />
You could see in his face<br />
The fervor he had as a lad</p>
<p>As the coach waves him in<br />
He’s urged on by the din<br />
But too late he knows with a gasp</p>
<p>With his spirit strong<br />
He’d excited the throng<br />
But his reach had exceeded his grasp</p>
<p>These last months that he’d spent<br />
On the bench to repent<br />
For his failings brought on by his age</p>
<p>Had prepared him to fail<br />
Striving to no avail<br />
But his heart was igniting a rage</p>
<p>He had not played this long<br />
To have this his swan song<br />
To be mocked by that boy at the plate</p>
<p>They were blocking him wide<br />
Trying to force a slide<br />
Just in case that the ball got there late</p>
<p>They knew with his knee<br />
It’s the wrong place to be<br />
He would have to reach back with his hand</p>
<p>The tag, they were sure<br />
The out would insure<br />
His hourglass was now out of sand</p>
<p>The catcher reached out<br />
For the ball as a shout<br />
From the crowd said they knew he was done</p>
<p>He’d given his best<br />
But he’d failed this last test<br />
He would never deliver this run</p>
<p>He could feel the knee give<br />
And his reason to live<br />
Would be gone when the ump made his call</p>
<p>It was anguish he felt<br />
As hope started to melt<br />
When he heard the loud ‘pop’ of the ball</p>
<p>There guarding the plate<br />
Like St. Peter’s gate<br />
Stood the catcher a sneer on his face</p>
<p>“Old man you’ve had your day<br />
Now it’s your time to pay<br />
You’re too old to handle the pace”</p>
<p>He could not hear the crowd<br />
For his heart beat too loud<br />
As for one final slide he prepared</p>
<p>The catcher bent down<br />
His plight to compound<br />
The ump stooped to see how he fared</p>
<p>He’d be stripped of his pride<br />
At the end of this slide<br />
His career would end in defeat</p>
<p>With the last of his strength<br />
He extended full length<br />
And his dive tore his foe from his feet</p>
<p>The crowd stood to a man<br />
Now one unified fan<br />
And their roar his salvation pronounced</p>
<p>The umps arms spread wide<br />
The catcher lay on his side<br />
And grabbed for the ball as it bounced</p>
<p>Slowly he rose<br />
There was blood on his nose<br />
And the pain in his knee was intense</p>
<p>He should have been proud<br />
As he waved to the crowd<br />
His legacy now was immense</p>
<p>But the man simply turned<br />
To the catcher who’d spurned<br />
This ancient, decrepit old man</p>
<p>For a moment he gazed<br />
At the hand that was raised<br />
With their shake they said all a man can</p>
<p>His career now was through<br />
To this game he’d been true<br />
For his sins he’d atoned here today</p>
<p>They were still in their seats<br />
In reverence of this feat<br />
By the man they had come to watch play</p>
<p>His teammates just stood<br />
For they felt that they should<br />
Let him walk all alone from the field</p>
<p>This game takes its toll<br />
Here he’d given his soul<br />
His redemption, refusing to yield</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/04/the-deacon/">The Deacon</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
