										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>



<p>It’s easy to look around at the goings on of our current
situation world-wide and panic.&nbsp; It’s
also easy to say, “I’m not gonna drink the kool aid,” run to Circle K for a
Thirstbuster and…..catch the plague.&nbsp; Ok,
so it’s not the plague but it’s being presented that way.&nbsp; Don’t misunderstand what I’m saying.&nbsp; This is obviously serious and dangerous.&nbsp; People are dying from this mutated version of
this flu-like virus.&nbsp; What I am saying is
the hysteria around this situation is unprecedented.&nbsp; </p>



<p>At first I couldn’t understand why.&nbsp; Stay home, wash your hands, social distance
and we’ll all be ok.&nbsp; No reason to
panic.&nbsp; We aren’t talking about scaling
mountains to find an effective containment technique.&nbsp; This is pretty basic stuff.&nbsp; It isn’t the first time we have seen an
unbelievably potent version of the flu.&nbsp;
Some quick research will tell you that, back in 2009, the Swine Flu
infected upwards of 20% of the world’s population and, by some estimates, took
nearly 600,000 lives across the world.&nbsp;
Those are big numbers.&nbsp; So why is
this worse?&nbsp; Let’s set aside the science
of what’s going on right now.&nbsp; I know
that’s hard to do, but I want to take a look at something outside the virus
itself.&nbsp; </p>



<p>My daughter is a sophomore in high school.&nbsp; This social distancing thing doesn’t work for
her.&nbsp; She is used to constant contact
with her friends and freedom to plan activities on the fly, capture them on her
iPhone, and post them to the social media outlet of her choice.&nbsp; Having to stay home and hang out with her
parents and her little brother is being tolerated well considering how big a
variation from her norm it is.&nbsp; I imagine
most parents of high school kids are facing similar situations, attitudes,
eyerolls, whatever.&nbsp; Inside we adults are
all loving the extra time with these kiddos on the verge of adulthood.&nbsp; These moments are precious to us because they
are fleeting.&nbsp; Maybe someday the teens
will appreciate the memories as well, but I digress.</p>



<p>Did you know that the kids set to graduate high school this spring were mostly born in the year 2001?  Kids born between 2001 and 2005 make up the vast majority of our high school students.  Did you also know the iPod was first released in 2001, and the first iPhone was released in 2009, followed in 2010 by the first iPad?  MySpace came to be in 2003, Facebook was 2004, Youtube in 2005, and Twitter chirped its first characters in 2006.  Why am I telling you this?  To highlight that this generation of high school student has never lived in a world where a handheld device has not connected them to the world.  </p>



<p>They are bombarded moment by moment with information,
misinformation, opinion, acceptance, rejection, and what their best life is
supposed to look like, all in a clickbait environment competing for the 3-5
seconds of attention they devote to any one headline before moving on to the
next.&nbsp; Since the advent of the
smartphone, primarily the iPhone, in 2009, there have been nine 7.0 or greater
magnitude earthquakes on record, at least eight hurricanes making landfall and
causing major damage, ten terror attacks in the U.S., and eight school
shootings.&nbsp; Add to that the chaos in the
middle east, like the Arab Spring, the plane crashes, tornadoes, immigration
debate, climate change claims, and perhaps the scariest thing of all, the
politicians, and you can see how an increase in mental health issues like
anxiety and depression are not surprising.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>Now I know what you’re thinking.&nbsp;
We all are bombarded in the same way, and other generations have faced
incredible challenges too.&nbsp; You’re right,
of course!&nbsp; Let’s look at how we
react.&nbsp; In 2009 there was no panic around
the Swine Flu.&nbsp; There was no
hoarding.&nbsp; There was no daily press
conference or constant Twitter barage.&nbsp;
Many of us react to “News” because headlines were important when we were
growing up.&nbsp; The news was a source of
information we trusted to help us navigate current events.&nbsp; It sort of explains why people are buying out
local stores of all kinds of products.&nbsp;
Fear is a powerful motivator when dispensed from a source that we grant
authority in our life.&nbsp; </p>



<p>But this will be the first generation that didn’t have to seek
out news.&nbsp; They are alerted to it moment
by moment 24/7, and have been for the majority of their formative years.&nbsp; I wonder what kind of long term impact this
is going to have.&nbsp; Will it desensitize
them to real danger?&nbsp; Will it leave them
in a constant state of anxiety?&nbsp; Will they
remember this pandemic as the same kind of world altering event that occurred
in September of 2001?&nbsp; Or will they just
see the news as chicken little and ignore all the falling bits of blue when it
finally happens?&nbsp; One thing is for sure,
with the inundation of negative news coverage and the social media spin that
accompanies each event, these kids are The Apocalypse Generation.</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2020/03/the-apocalypse-generation/">The Apocalypse Generation</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
