										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been told that no matter how big you build your workshop, it won’t be big enough and you’ll regret not building bigger.  Going into my workshop project, knowing ahead of time that space was at a premium, I had conceded to the fact that regret was inevitable.  But, given my options, it was either regret or nothing at all&#8230;and I chose regret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning a workshop with limited square footage takes some creative thinking.  It helps to know what types of projects you’ll be working on, but you definitely want to plan with flexibility in mind, because you never really know what you may be inspired to build in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table saw tends to be the one piece of equipment that requires the largest footprint.   The saw itself is not the challenge, it’s the in-feed and out-feed space that using the saw requires.   If you want to be able to rip material that is 8’ in length, that means you need at least 8’ of space both in front of and behind the blade.   That translates into a minimum of 17 linear feet&#8230;and that’s a lot of real estate.  For my shop, given its long and narrow layout, there was really only one location that would work.   Once that location had been chosen, it was time to start planning the rest of the tool layout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing I did as I was planning my shop project was to talk to as many people as I could that had workshops.   I was able to get a tour of some of their shops, and it was very helpful as I was planning my own.  A piece of advice that was consistent, was to put as many tools as possible on wheels to keep the layout as flexible as possible.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though I had not acquired all of my tools when I was planning, I knew the tools that I needed to find a home for in my shop.   In addition to the table saw, I was going to need a spot for a drill press, miter saw, planer, jointer, router table, band saw, dust collection, a stationary workbench, and lumber storage.   I determined the approximate footprint of each of these items and I started placing equipment on my floor plan.   The layout that I thought might work, looked something like this.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout.png" rel="lightbox[shoplayout]"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1611 size-large" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout-1024x465.png" alt="ToolLayout" width="1024" height="465" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout-1024x465.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout-300x136.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout-768x348.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout-330x150.png 330w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout-690x313.png 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ToolLayout.png 1027w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a place for everything and enough remaining floor space to maneuver supplies and projects.   It was time to start building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After dozens of google searches, I had found examples of miter saw stations, out-feed/assembly tables, lumber storage, and mobile tool stands.   I took note of what I liked, what seemed functional, and came up with my own designs that pulled ideas from what I had seen online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because what works on paper may not work in reality, I decided to set up my shop in a ‘temporary’ mode.   I set up a makeshift outfeed table with an old hollow core door on saw horses.   I stacked up some pieces of plywood to make a miter saw stand, and even laid some boards across some boxes where I planned to build my workbench.   With all of these temporary workstations in place, I started to build </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my shop furniture.  This was one of the best decisions I could have made.  I was able to put my proposed layout to a complete test and fine tune it before I built something that was not going to work.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was researching shop furniture, I realized that some woodworkers make shop furniture that is fancier than the stuff I have in my living room.   I took a much simpler approach, building most things out of birch plywood and common building materials.   I did spruce up my stationary workbench with a layer of solid oak flooring that I picked from the seconds bin at the local flooring store.   Being the centerpiece of the shop, my outfeed table got a little nicer treatment with maple trim and a high gloss finish.   I outfitted the wall above my workbench with a french cleat system which has proven to be a very effective system for flexible wall storage.</span></p>

<p>When it comes to picking the best tools to outfit a shop, there are dozens of options and price points.   I was pretty realistic about my shop expectations.  I’m not a professional woodworker and definitely did not need a shop full of high end tools, but I wanted tools that would still yield quality results.   For most tools, I tried to buy used where I could&#8230;though in some cases, the used prices were not low enough to take a chance on somebody else’s problem.   I did pick up a nice Delta 6” Jointer that was priced right and had a lot of life left in it.  Two of my favorite tool finds were from a local retiree that restores old shop tools.   I bought a 1950’s Rockwell Delta 10” bandsaw and a 1940’s Craftsman Drill press from him.   Good old fashioned, heavy duty tools&#8230;that may lack some of the features of the latest and greatest shop tools, but make up for it in their quality American made construction.</p>

<p>For dust collection, I read a lot of good reviews from the Harbor Freight single stage dust collector.   I normally would not recommend buying any serious tools from Harbor Freight, but after researching their dust collector, it seemed like a good option.  I replaced the stock filter bag with a 1 micron unit.   The unit comes with a Y connector.   I have a dedicated hose to my table saw from one side and the other is setup with a quick disconnect fitting and gets moved from tool to tool as needed.  A ceiling mount ShopFox Air Cleaner helps keep the suspended dust to a minimum.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few projects, I have found that my layout works pretty well.   I’ve added some random shelves and a folding work surface for more storage and assembly area.  Overall, considering the size of the shop, it’s a very workable space that should serve me well for years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like no two woodworkers are alike, no two woodworking shops are alike.  If you are in the process of building your own workshop, think about the types of things you want to build, research other shops for ideas, and keep things mobile.  In the end, it’s all about making sawdust and having some fun in the process.</span></p>The post <a href="/2016/03/planning-a-workshop-just-roll-with-it/">Planning A Workshop – Just Roll With It</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>One man's journey to a basement woodworking shop</p>
The post <a href="/2016/02/it-all-started-with-a-table-saw/">It All Started With A Table Saw</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It all started with a saw&#8230;an early seventies Craftsman contractor table saw.</p>
<p>I had dabbled with woodworking for years. My Dad, and his Dad, and his dad before him had all been born with the gift of taking a pile of boards and turning them into something functional. It really didn&#8217;t seem to matter the scale of the project, whether a bunk bed for one of their children or an entire house, my forefathers were skilled craftsman. At a very young age, I caught the same bug. To this day I still have, and use, the 12 oz. hammer my Dad bought me so that I could help him install the decking of a house when I was only 11 years old. I was one of the only kids in my class that took wood shop in school beyond the required years. My home still displays items I made at home as a kid with nothing more than a hammer, a circular saw, and a bottle of wood glue.</p>
<p>When I was finally able to get my own home, I continued to dabble in woodworking, making various pieces of simple furniture for our home and for the occasional gift. My shop was nothing more than my garage. My tools were predominantly carpentry tools used to support remodeling projects for myself and others. I slowly acquired some relatively inexpensive wood working-ish tools. Emphasis on the &#8216;ish&#8217;. I had a jig that attached to my router to make biscuit joints. I had a straight edge I&#8217;d clamp to panels in lieu of a table saw. A $29 jig saw stood in for a proper band saw for cutting less than straight lines. Given time and financial constraints, these make-shift tools had to suffice for several years of projects.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1562 alignleft" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablesaw-1-300x225.jpg" alt="tablesaw" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablesaw-1-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablesaw-1-330x248.jpg 330w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablesaw-1-690x518.jpg 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablesaw-1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A good friend of mine grew up about an hour from where I was living, and we&#8217;d often use his parents’ home as a base for many of our outdoor activities. His dad was also a carpenter, handyman, and hobby woodworker. He had a barn full of tools he had collected over the years&#8230;and his basement was set up for woodworking, with a nice old Craftsman table saw as the centerpiece of his shop. I always enjoyed talking &#8216;shop&#8217; with him when we visited. He&#8217;d ask me questions about how I would build something, sometimes out of curiosity, but other times I think he was testing me to see if a young smart alec IT guy actually knew anything about building. I think I passed the test most days. After a decade of getting to know him, his time on earth came to an all too early end&#8230;leaving a hole in the lives of his friends and family and a void in the visits to my friend&#8217;s homestead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1559 alignright" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopUnderConstruction-300x225.jpg" alt="ShopUnderConstruction" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopUnderConstruction-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopUnderConstruction-330x248.jpg 330w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopUnderConstruction-690x518.jpg 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopUnderConstruction.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Some time later, I was given the opportunity to become the next caretaker of his trusty Craftsman Table Saw. For anybody that has ever done any research on the interwebs, the American made Craftsman Contractor saws have been the workhorse of many a hobby woodworker for many years. I put the saw in my cluttered basement with the intent of one day building a proper wood shop that would be a fitting home for it.</p>
<p>Far too many years later, my basement was still cluttered and the saw was still sitting there, collecting dust. It was time to do something about it.</p>
<p>Planning a woodworking shop can be a fun, but frustrating, activity. You either have to work with the space you have, or you have to create a new space. Having watched Norm and the New Yankee Workshop for many years, a nice New England Barn was my workshop of choice&#8230;but my budget disagreed. So I started to look at the only space I had to work with, my basement.</p>
<p>About half of my basement is dedicated to things other than making sawdust. What was left was an area about 30’ long by 12’ wide….but interrupted by a very large Chimney, water heater, and furnace in the middle of the space. After doing all the math, it looked like I would be able to salvage about 275 square feet for a workshop space. Definitely not the New Yankee Workshop, but still workable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1557 size-full" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan.png" alt="ShopFloorPlan" width="1122" height="471" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan.png 1122w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan-300x126.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan-768x322.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan-1024x430.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan-330x139.png 330w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan-690x290.png 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopFloorPlan-1050x441.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" /></p>
<p>To make this space work there were a few things I had to address…</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting enough power for lights and outlets</li>
<li>Keeping things dry</li>
<li>Containing dust</li>
<li>Making things bright</li>
<li>Access to get lumber in and furniture out</li>
</ul>
<p>To get sufficient power to the shop, and to prevent running out of room in my main service panel, I put a 100AMP subpanel in the shop area. I’m no electrician, so my only advice here is to get some help from someone who is. I ended up running two switched lighting circuits, two 20 AMP outlet circuits to power my tools, and a dedicated 20 AMP circuit for a dust collector. At this point, all my tools run on 110V, so I did not need to run any 220V circuits. It helps to know your expected tool layout as you plan your wiring so that you have lights and outlets where you need them. Fortunately, since most basements have unfinished ceilings, running extra wire to fix something you may have missed is relatively easy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1558 alignleft" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopOutlets-300x225.jpg" alt="ShopOutlets" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopOutlets-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopOutlets-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopOutlets-330x248.jpg 330w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopOutlets-690x518.jpg 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopOutlets-773x580.jpg 773w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ShopOutlets.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Basements tend to be damp. To minimize that problem I painted the block walls with Dry-Lok and put in a dehumidifier. It has been cold and dry here in upstate New York, so this spring will be the real test.</p>
<p>Another problem to tackle was dust control. I definitely planned to use a dust collector and a ceiling mount air cleaner, but having the furnace exposed to all of the shop dust, was not only a potential fire hazard, but a likely source of dust being spread through the rest of the house. After checking with my local furnace guys for required clearances and air flow, I planned to box in the furnace and water heater, making sure that I designed the enclosure with adequate access for service and cleaning. To get a sufficient source of fresh air, I cut 4 large openings in the access doors and covered them with furnace filters to allow air to flow, but not saw dust.</p>
<p>Basements tend to be dark. The white Dry-Lok on the block walls certainly helped make things feel brighter, but the dozen fluorescent light fixtures added the necessary light &#8212; so bright I can probably get a jump start on my spring planting if I’m so inclined.</p>
<p>Getting large items up and down basement stairs can be a challenge. At the same time I was designing my shop, I was finishing off our laundry area, which is where the stairs enter the basement. I designed the area to support maneuvering 4’x8’ sheet goods. I’m able to bring longer boards through a basement window, eliminating the need to haul them through the house and laundry area. I did price out a Bilco Door setup to make basement access easier, but the $6,000 price tag made that less appealing.</p>
<p>Every woodworker’s needs are different. The basement setup that I have may not work for all shops, but for a hobby woodworker, it seems sufficient. With some careful planning, it can actually be quite efficient.</p>
<p>Next month, I will talk about my tool layout and cover some of the actual equipment that outfits my shop.</p>The post <a href="/2016/02/it-all-started-with-a-table-saw/">It All Started With A Table Saw</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
