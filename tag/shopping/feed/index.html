										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“No, Sara…nooo!!” I cried, again and again, as one by one the text messages came in.&nbsp; I followed her progress intently, her movements visible only by the breadcrumbs she left on my phone.&nbsp; I visualized her path, serpentine by my way of thinking.&nbsp; Unstructured.&nbsp; Purposeful but inefficient.&nbsp; Now north, now west, then north again, only to go south immediately thereafter.&nbsp; It would not have been the route I would have chosen.&nbsp; It was neither sequential nor, to my mind, logical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But still the messages came in, unrelenting, unsettling, disquieting.&nbsp; It is not easy to watch as things spiral out of your control.&nbsp; Another hand on the rudder, another voice shouting as your ship tacks to and fro without you even being aboard.&nbsp; It is the lack of control that drives you crazy.&nbsp; This is action that you yourself have confidently undertaken more times than you can count.&nbsp; You are good at it.&nbsp; The results certain.&nbsp; Dependable.&nbsp; Pleasing.</p>



<p>“No Sara,” I cry again as the fatal text comes in.&nbsp; Each previous text was a small incision, a mere papercut.&nbsp; But this last is a slash to the juggler.&nbsp; I winced when Sara had substituted another brand of hot dogs for my beloved Ball Park Beef Franks.&nbsp; I whimpered when the Kraft deluxe mac and cheese was replaced with the store brand basic.&nbsp; I cried when the chicken breasts were refunded, and I wept unashamedly when the family pack of T-bone steaks suffered the same fate, the fact that the Dinty Moore stew had survived unscathed being meager solace.&nbsp; But now I am inconsolable. Devastated.&nbsp; Stricken with a sadness the depth of which I may never escape.&nbsp; I hold the phone in my hand.&nbsp; The text stares back at me.&nbsp; Tauntingly.&nbsp; Remorseless.&nbsp; The loss too painful to countenance, I look away.&nbsp; The Breyers cherry vanilla ice cream has been refunded.&nbsp; Life no longer has meaning.</p>



<p>And then the phone chimes again with one final, incongruously cheery message.&nbsp; “Fry’s is on the way!!”&nbsp; And now I am left to make the decision.&nbsp; How much do you tip a woman whom you have never met, who may be saving your life, but has destroyed your will to fight on?</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2020/04/tipping-sara/">Tipping Sara</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
