Indeed! Our youngest sister, ironically, has enjoyed the largest number of world-wide travels, so we left the travel arrangements to her. A few months and $900 later, I found myself on the soft sands of the Mexican Riviera, enjoying unlimited frozen cocktails alongside my two gorgeous sisters. Mary described the process as amazingly simple.</p>
<p>It began with a visit to Southwest Vacations online. There are many other internet travel sites that provide equal services and comparable prices, but Mary shopped first with Southwest, a name I approved of, recognized, and trusted. Booking a trip with Southwest Vacations was as easy as booking a regular US flight with them. We named our preferred dates, saw the options of marvelous destinations, chose the type of room we wanted, and combined these simple logistics with Mary’s experience. Her knowledge of Caribbean travel and all-inclusive resorts, along with consumer reviews on TripAdvisor, helped us choose our journey’s end. As she clicked through the website’s prompts, Mary even secured transportation from the airport to the resort and back again. Southwest thought of everything! All I had to do was pay for my portion of the trip and obtain a passport. Not long after, my sisters and I left Baltimore, MD on a direct flight to Cancun, Mexico. (Southwest Airlines provides international flights to many destinations from a number of American airports, but Mary lives in MD and the three of us decided to meet there and begin our journey together.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6.jpg" rel="lightbox[1684]"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1690" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-225x300.jpg" alt="mexico6" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-690x920.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6-435x580.jpg 435w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico6.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Flying to a foreign land with a familiar airline like Southwest was a comfortable treat. The procedures and service were standard and enjoyably predictable. The flight attendants were in jolly good moods and generous, upon learning that we were celebrating a special event – with the snacks and beverages. As the four-hour flight approached its end, the crew talked us through the paperwork we each needed to complete to pass through customs without incident. We landed safely, secured our baggage without problem, and navigated through customs seamlessly. Then, the only hiccups we experienced transpired. Because our pilot has transported us so remarkably well, he actually delivered us to Cancun ahead of schedule, and unfortunately, our transportation was not ready for us. The company was expecting us, our names were on the log, and a driver was scheduled to assist us, but because our flight arrived early, we had to wait on the curb for about thirty minutes before he completed his previous run and picked us up. While this disturbed us some, we chatted with other passengers, shared travel stories, and – had we wanted one at the time – vendors provided beverages nearby. Note: Our limited Spanish proficiency did not present a problem for us as we communicated with the airport staff or shuttle service employees. Their English was good, and what Spanish we retained from high school Spanish classes decades prior was sufficient.</p>
<p>Soon, our driver arrived and cheerfully swooped up our bags. We scurried behind him and loaded into the vehicle. The last leg <a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1.jpg" rel="lightbox[1684]"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1685" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-225x300.jpg" alt="mexico1" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-690x920.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1-435x580.jpg 435w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mexico1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>of our short journey was underway, and within about thirty minutes – all filled with friendly small talk and humorous Spanish lessons &#8212; he safely delivered us to our resort, the Iberostar Paraiso Beach. The property was beautiful. Open-air lobbies featuring large couches and plush seating welcomed us. Peacocks, swans, parrots filled the landscape with their beauty and songs. Waterways moved through the architecture, complete with beautiful fish and turtles. Generous staff members relieved us of our baggage and offered fruity cocktails in exchange. The front-desk staff greeted us with clear communication and terrific service, maps, and information about the property before connecting us quickly with the concierge, who assisted us with our meal-planning for the length of our stay.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he offered us opportunities to enjoy excursions off the premises, but the resort was so large and lovely, we did not feel the need to leave it. Our beach-front accommodations thrilled us from sunrise to our mid-afternoon siestas. The Caribbean views, clear water, near-by open-air food provisions, complementary snorkeling filled our days, and when we wanted a change of scenery, the enormous pools with their swim-up bars, ice cream parlors, and aquatic games kept us entertained each afternoon. Nightly we dined at fantastic restaurants and enjoyed prompt, complementary room service. If we desired, we could enjoy a live show after dinner or visit the dance club. On-site shopping was available as well.</p>

From the easy planning to the affordability, the quality facilities to the amazing people we met, our Southwest vacation with Iberostar was an experience we will seek to repeat when the next milestone arrives.</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/05/iberostar-paraiso-beach-travel-review/">Iberostar Paraiso Beach: Travel Review</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re a kid that grows up in the some of the prettiest mountains in the country, one would think that’s where you would go to find your inner peace, your bliss, your zen. But when you’re a mountain kid who lives in the desert, it’s the smell of salty air, the temperate clime, and the ocean breeze that renews your soul. That’s exactly what I found this weekend in San Diego.     I was able to find a decent hotel for a relatively decent price (&lt; $200/nite) that was in close proximity to everything I wanted to do, and also happened to be housing the Portland State college basketball team. The last bit was just random happenstance and had no bearing on me choosing the hotel, but it was still fun to stand next to a guy a foot taller than me and listen to him order a small Starbuck’s drink that looked more like a sippy cup in his hand than a latte. Over a two day, two night visit I was able to frequent a prime local attraction (Sea World), and two local restaurants that I would definitely encourage anyone to try, given the chance.</p>
<p>Sea World was everything you would hope it to be. Lots of learning, lots of shows, and adorable animals that you wouldn’t normally get to see, let alone see up close. We made three “extra adventure” purchases at the start of our day. The first was the “All Day Dining” wrist bands. It was $35 for each adult. The first meal we ate would have come to $38 with an entree, side, and drink each. The second would have been $37. We ate a third time and more than got our money’s worth. The red velvet cake is delicious, and I didn’t even feel bad about it, considering the number of miles I walked over the course of the day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2.jpg"  rel="lightbox[1628] attachment wp-att-1631"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1631 size-medium" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-300x300.jpg" alt="sandiego2" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-330x330.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-690x690.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-1050x1050.jpg 1050w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2-580x580.jpg 580w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego2.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The second and third extras were animal related. For $50 per person, my wife and I got to take a back stage tour of the Penguin Encounter. Not only did we learn that Sea World makes 6-8000 lbs of snow daily to fill the encounter, but that a penguin can hit an employee with a high power stream of feces at a good 3 feet away. That’s entertainment that you can’t put a dollar figure on. Though I do suggest hand sanitizer afterwards. We met and got to pet a 4 month Adelie penguin. He was quite the talker, and was surprisingly soft, due to his 60-100 feathers per square inch. The next stop in the tour allowed us to meet a 30 day old baby Adelie and that’s when I realized what “soft” actually meant. The down that covered this little guy made you want to snuggle him and never let go.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego1.jpg"  rel="lightbox[1628] attachment wp-att-1630"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1630" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego1-150x150.jpg" alt="sandiego1" width="150" height="150" /></a>Our next encounter was on the opposite end of the size spectrum. After the 2 foot tall Adelie, the 13 foot long, 900 lb, Beluga whale definitely qualified as mammoth. For about 15 minutes we posed as Sea World trainers and had our baby Beluga waving, singing, and even giving good bye kisses. It was the perfect end to a day of exploring what sea life is like in the Pacific.</p>
<p>After a quick trip back to the hotel for a shower, we headed to dinner. We found a great local place in Pacific Beach called <a href="http://www.backyardpb.com" target="_blank">The Backyard Kitchen and Tap</a>. Since we did a good job of sampling most of what the Sea World restaurants had to offer, <a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6.jpg"  rel="lightbox[1628] attachment wp-att-1635"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1635 size-medium" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6-225x300.jpg" alt="sandiego6" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6-690x920.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6-1050x1400.jpg 1050w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6-435x580.jpg 435w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sandiego6.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>the stop in at Backyard was a light affair. We ordered three appetizers including, bruschetta, baked Buffalo wings, and a meat and cheese board. The servings were ample and delicious. They also feature a full bar and a great wall mural breaking down different makes of Whiskey, Bourbon, and Moonshine. The venue itself was enormous, with ample TV’s, pool tables, and even indoor fire pits. You can’t go wrong at Backyard either for dinner, or just apps and drinks.</p>
<p>After a well deserved night’s rest, we made our way to downtown San Diego for breakfast. The restaurant we chose was <a href="http://cafe222.com" target="_blank">Cafe 222</a>. At 10:00 AM on a Sunday morning we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table that was outside on the upstairs patio in the glorious Southern California weather. After seeing several pancakes bigger than my head pass by the table, I decided to go with bacon and eggs so as not to induce a diabetic coma. I will admit to stealing a few bites of my wife’s waffle when she wasn’t looking though. It was expansive in its own right. The food was excellent, as was the service. We were on our way in about 45 minutes, walking from there to Seaport Village for a little shopping before heading home.</p>
<p>For a two day trip we got a lot in and had a blast doing it. Now that I’m back home in the desert southwest, I’m already planning my next trip to our more temperate neighbors to the West.</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/03/an-escape-to-san-diego/">An Escape to San Diego</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/01/catskill-mountain-hiking-gear-up-wrap-up/">Catskill Mountain Hiking – Gear Up, Wrap Up</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been following our hiking series, you can probably tell that we like hiking and we love hiking the Catskills.   We’ve focused on the Thirty Five Hundred Footers, but there are dozens of other peaks in the Catskills that are well worth exploring.   For those that want to gain full membership in the Catskill 3500 Club, not only will you have to climb all thirty five peaks, but you’ll have to climb four of them again in the winter months.   While many of the Catskill hikes can be done without too much special preparation, once you start to string peaks together, or head off trail you’re going to want to put a little more attention into planning your hike and gearing up properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what kind of gear do you need for a successful hike?   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with where the rubber meets the road&#8230;or the trail&#8230; you are going to want a good pair of hiking boots.  Boots come in lots of configurations ranging from lightweight, low height trails shoes, to heavy duty backpacking boots that will provide the support needed to log mile after mile with a heavy pack on your back.   Look for boots that provide good ankle support, are not too tight, or too loose, and provide protection against the elements with features such as Goretex waterproof linings.   Make sure you pair up your hiking boots with a good pair of hiking socks.  I’m a big fan of Salomon boots and Smart-Wool socks, but there are lots of options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1535 alignleft" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikinggear-225x300.jpg" alt="hikinggear" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikinggear-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikinggear-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikinggear-690x920.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikinggear-435x580.jpg 435w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikinggear.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />You are going to want to carry some food and some gear, so you will definitely need a pack.   For shorter day hikes in warmer weather, a very small backpack or even a lumbar pack will work just fine.  Make sure it can carry a couple bottles of water or a hydration bladder, has room for an extra clothing layer, and for some food.   Again, the longer the hike, the more you’ll need to carry.  If your hiking season starts in the early spring or stretches into the fall, clothing layers are definitely important.   You never know how long you’ll be in the woods, and you want to be prepared for temperature changes throughout the day and the elevation.   A list of items that your pack should contain might look like this:   compass, knife or multi-tool, flashlight or headlamp, bug repellant, whistle, moleskin, small first-aid kit, a way to start a fire, and waterproof trail maps.   You may want to consider items like water purification tablets or life-straw, duct tape, some paracord, an emergency bivvy, and if you’re heading off trail, I consider a GPS to be a must have item.   For multi-day backpacking, you’ll need even more gear&#8230;but my hiking experience has been limited to day hikes&#8230;so I’ll point you to your local outfitters for guidance on mandatory backpacking gear.  My packs include an Osprey 24L day pack and a Mountainsmith Lumbar pack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like good boots, proper clothing is a must.   Avoid cotton and stick with higher tech breathable fabrics.  Cotton can get wet and then makes you cold.   The more modern fabrics breathe well, wick away moisture, and will keep you more comfortable throughout your hike.  Dress in layers..and add and remove as the conditions warrant.  Zip off hiking pants provide a lot of flexibility for handling temperature and trail condition changes.   A hiking oriented rain jacket is a good idea, and if you’re hiking outside of the summer season, remember gloves and a hat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1534 alignright" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikingfoot-300x225.jpg" alt="hikingfoot" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikingfoot-300x225.jpg 300w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikingfoot-768x576.jpg 768w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikingfoot-330x248.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikingfoot-690x518.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikingfoot-773x580.jpg 773w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hikingfoot.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />And finally, don’t forget good nutrition.  Not eating properly is a sure recipe for a painful hike.   I’m a big fan of the PB&amp;J sandwich&#8230;but my pack always has a Power Bar, some trail mix, often a Clif bar, bananas, and plenty of water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other optional items may include trekking poles, crampons if you’re covering icy terrain, and even snow shoes if conditions warrant them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom line, it pays to be prepared.  There are lots of single peak hikes that might only be a few miles round trip, and they probably don’t warrant a lot of gear.  But as your hikes get tougher and longer, take the time to bring the right gear.  Much of it will stay in your bag hike after hike, but you don’t want to find yourself wishing you had brought something you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiking in general, and hiking the Catskills specifically, can be a lot of fun.  Take your time to research your hikes.  Check out some of the resources we’ve shared, and after you’ve caught up on your reading at RelativelyRandom.com, get off the couch, gear up, get outside, and take a hike!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</em><br />
<em> I took the one less traveled by,</em><br />
<em> And that has made all the difference.”</em> – Robert Frost</p>
<p>When setting out to hike the thirty-five 3500’ Catskill Mountain peaks, sixteen of these will require taking the trail less traveled.   While many of the 3500’ summits in the Catskills can be reached by well marked DEC trails, there are some that require what is referred to as a bushwhack, either all or in part.</p>
<p>Having spent most of my hiking career being guided by brightly colored blazes on trees and rocks, with very little risk of getting lost, the idea of leaving a perfectly good trail and making my own way through the forest to a peak that isn’t even within sight, was a bit unnerving. …Actually it was a bit more than unnerving, it was frightening.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JustWoods.jpg" rel="lightbox[1500]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1502 alignleft" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JustWoods-225x300.jpg" alt="JustWoods" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JustWoods-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JustWoods-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JustWoods.jpg 432w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cannister.jpg" rel="lightbox[1500]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1501 alignright" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cannister-225x300.jpg" alt="Cannister" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cannister-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cannister-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cannister.jpg 432w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Every bushwhack hike is a little different. Some of them have a DEC trail that gets nearly to the summit, and there’s only a short off trail excursion required to reach the peak.   Others are nearly entirely off trail&#8230;often requiring trudging through miles of thick brush, nettles, creek crossings, and ledges that you have to negotiate to reach the top.   Occasionally a herd path can be found that makes the climb a whole lot easier…but it’s not common to find one until you are very close to the top of the mountain. Unlike hiking trailed peaks, the trailless peaks have a canister somewhere on the summit containing a notebook and some writing implements for you to record your name in hiking history. I’m not saying it makes it all worth it, but it does add some fun to each hike.</p>
<p>Fortunately, coordinates for many of the peaks can be found online. So, if you have a GPS or are really good with a topo map and a compass, the chances of reaching the summit are greatly increased.   There are also some very good sites that give detailed descriptions of each hike, offering tips on finding the best approach and obstacles to avoid.   <a href="http://www.catskillhiker.net/" target="_blank">Catskill Hiker</a> and <a href="http://www.catskillmountaineer.com/" target="_blank">Catskill Mountaineer</a> are two of the sites I have found to be the most useful.</p>
<p>After several of these trailless adventures, the fear of ending up wandering through the woods for the rest of my days has decreased greatly…and that first step in to the unmarked forest can be quite exhilarating.</p>
<p>When Robert Frost penned the words of his poem “The Road Not Taken”, he lead the reader through the process of choosing between two paths that would undoubtedly have very different outcomes, and the choice of the one less traveled, appeared to have been the right one… when it comes to hiking the Catskill Mountain 3500’ peaks, taking the trail less travelled isn’t just the right choice, for sixteen of these peaks, it’s the only choice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever noticed that there are things in life that are given names that simply don&#8217;t make sense&#8230;  many being the subject of TV commercials and cheesy infomercials.  The name alone neither tells you what the thing is or what it does&#8230; for example, the Flowbee, the Swiffer, the Snuggie, and even Ear Buds leave one with the impression that some sort of medical attention may be required.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some items that seem to be named perfectly&#8230;and there&#8217;s no confusion as to what they when hearing their name&#8230; Shredded Wheat, lawn mower, bread maker.  Any questions?  I didn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6.jpg" rel="lightbox[1477]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1469" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6-1024x768.jpg" alt="DP_6" width="650" height="487" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6-330x248.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6-690x518.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6-1050x788.jpg 1050w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6-773x580.jpg 773w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>The Devil&#8217;s Path in the Catskill Mountains may be one of the most aptly named trails on this planet.  The name describes the trail perfectly.  It truly is the work of the Devil and brings with it all the evil that one would expect.  But despite the name and all the misery that goes along with it, the Devil&#8217;s path is a stretch of trail that covers 5 mountains (6 with a short detour to Hunter Mountain) that is truly rewarding.</p>
<p>In total the Devil&#8217;s path covers 24 miles and contains over 15,000 feet of elevation gain/loss.   The climbs, both up and down, are steep and rugged.  The idea of a switch back is practically non-existent.  It&#8217;s a trail that is probably best suited to the weak of mind and strong of body&#8230;. characteristics that most often describe me.   A smarter man would look at a topographic map of this mountain range and simply not even attempt it.   Fortunately, for those who do tackle it, there are breathtaking views at various points along the trail that make it worth the effort.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4.jpg" rel="lightbox[1477]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1471" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4-1024x768.jpg" alt="DP_4" width="650" height="487" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4-330x248.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4-690x518.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4-1050x788.jpg 1050w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4-773x580.jpg 773w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DP_4.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>It is possible to hike the Devil&#8217;s path in sections.   There are a couple trailheads that are not too far apart, that make it possible to drop a car at one end and hike from the other.   The trail covers the following peaks:  Indian Head (3,573 ft), Twin (3,640 ft), Sugarloaf (3,800 ft), Plateau (3,840 ft) and West Kil<br />
l (3,880 ft) mountains&#8230;and with a 3.6 mile detour Hunter (4,040 ft).   The Jimmy Dolan Notch, Pecoy Notch, and Mink Hollow Notch Trails all provide an escape into the valley below.</p>
<p>We climbed Indian Head, Twin, and Sugarloaf starting at the East end of the trail, taking advantage of the various notch trails to make shorter day hikes. We climbed both Plateau and Hunter Mountain from Devil&#8217;s Tombstone parking in the notch on Rt. 214&#8230;and both are brutal ascents.  The top of Plateau rewards the hiker with a nice, long, generally level path across the summit through dense evergreens as you make your way to the descent on the other side.   The highlight of hiking Hunter Mountain is taking the 1.8 mile trail to the fire tower on the peak.  You can&#8217;t climb into the top of the structure, but you can make it most of the way up before reaching the barricade&#8230;and it&#8217;s pretty high&#8230;and on a windy day is guaranteed to get your heart<br />
rate a notch higher than it was from making the grunt up the mountain.</p>

<p>The Devil&#8217;s path is a very difficult and physically demanding trail that challenges even the most experienced of hikers. In addition to the spectacular views, the most compelling reason to conquer this terrain is being able to put 5 3500&#8242; peaks (6 if you include the short detour to Hunter Mountain) behind you.   &#8230;and if this section of the Catskills is a precursor to an eternity in hell with the Devil himself, hiking it is likely motivation enough to change the ways of even the wickedest of souls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Catskills Mountains offer a wide variety of hiking opportunities.  There are steep rugged climbs to peaks so thick with fir trees that there’s no view to be seen.  There are gradual climbs that offer breathtaking vistas that include landscape from multiple states.   The Escarpment Trail is a 23.9 Mile hike that offers all of the above.   Not only does the Escarpment offer outstanding hiking, but given that much of this terrain was the inspiration for nineteenth century artists such as Thomas Cole and Frederic church, there’s a sense of history that can be felt as you gaze upon some of the very same views that these artists captured on canvas over 150 years ago.</span></p>
<p>There are many ways to tackle the Escarpment Trail.   Ambitious day hikers may hike the entire thing during the daylight hours of a long summer day.   Many backpackers turn this into a 3 day journey.  It can also be done in sections, but for some sections you will need a couple cars or a friend to drop you off at your starting point.</p>
<p>The trail starts just outside of Haines Falls, near the North-South Lake State Campground.   The first several miles are a pretty easy loop around the North-South Lake Campground area offering spectacular views of the Hudson River Valley from the site of the historic Catskill Mountain House, Artist Rock, and Newman’s Ledge.   After 7 ½ miles, the trail reaches North Point which despite having a relatively low elevation of 3,000’ has great views due to the lack of foliage.   Another half mile of hiking reaches the 3,180’ summit of North Mountain.</p>
<p>One more mile of hiking will bring you to Stoppel Point’s 3,420’ summit.  Near the summit, and within sight of the trail, are the remains of a plane crash from 1983.  It’s a pretty eerie feeling seeing the wreckage for the first time, but certainly makes the summit of this peak quite memorable.</p>
<p>The next 5 miles get pretty tough, especially towards the end as the trail makes the steep ascent to the summit of Blackhead mountain.  The elevation at the summit is 3,940’ making it the 4th highest peak in the Catskills, and the first 3500 footer in this hike.  Despite the temptation, don’t follow the signs towards Black Dome and Thomas Cole mountains.  Though they are two more 3500 footers, adding these peaks to your hike will add several more miles and a lot more climbing.   Instead, follow the trail towards the Windham High Peak and the Route 23 parking area.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HighPeak.jpg" rel="lightbox[1438]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1441" title="View from the descent of Windham High Peak" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HighPeak.jpg" alt="HighPeak" width="249" height="332" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HighPeak.jpg 600w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HighPeak-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HighPeak-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HighPeak-435x580.jpg 435w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /></a>The descent off Blackhead as the trail continues on toward Acra Point is very steep.  In wet conditions it can be quite a challenge.   It’s less than 3 miles until the 3,100’ summit of Acra Point. Just past the summit, there are some great overlooks providing views of the Maplecrest Valley to one side, and views towards Albany and the Adirondacks to the other side.  Another mile of hiking leads the trail over the top of Burnt Knob with only a couple more miles to the summit of Windham High Peak.   Windham High Peak has an elevation of 3,524’ and is the second 3500 footer on the Escarpment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The descent off Windham High Peak is fun, with varied terrain, and perfectly placed stepping stones through dense conifers, the two miles off the mountain go by quickly.   At that point, the trail makes its way past the Elm Ridge Lean To.   This is a great overnight stop for backpackers&#8230;and a fun place to grab a quick snack for those passing through.  Another long mile of hiking leads to the end of the Escarpment Trail and reaches the Rt. 23 trailhead.</span></p>
<p>In total, the 23.9 trail has over 5,100’ of climb, and at the end, there’s no question that you’ve climbed every one of those 5,100 feet.   Despite the strenuous effort required, and despite only checking off 2 of the 35 3500 footers, this trail offers a great challenge that is rewarded by outstanding views, gorgeous landscape, and forests ranging from dense hemlocks to sparse firs to majestic hardwoods.  This is definitely a must do trail for all Catskill Mountain hikers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Joni Mitchell’s song “Big Yellow Taxi” the lyrics tell us that ‘you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve got till it&#8217;s gone’…well I can attest to that.  I grew up in the heart of New York&#8217;s Catskill Mountains, specifically in a valley referred to as Big Hollow that lies in the shadow of six mountains, three of them being some of the highest in the Catskills.   I was a definite outdoors kid, from dawn to dusk the nearby woods and streams were my playgrounds.  But, I never really appreciated the magnitude of the creation that surrounded me&#8230;until I left the area. College and employment opportunities pulled me away from this mecca of adventure, and soon much flatter farmland and a really big lake, some would even call it great, became my new surroundings, leaving a void that could only be filled by the majestic views of the Catskill Mountains.</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed hiking.  At the age of seven with sleeping bag and toothbrush strapped to my back, my buddy&#8217;s Dad as our trail guide, and a half dozen kids all under the age of twelve, I went on my first overnight hiking trip.   After nearly losing our friend Scotty to the current of a mountain stream, sleeping in an open lean-to, having breakfast cooked over the fire, it was an experience I would never forget.  Growing up we&#8217;d continue to hike from time to time and probably made our way to the summit of about a half dozen mountains over the years.  Climbing some of them multiple times.   There’s something very cool about looking up at a peak far above the valley floor, and know that in a few hours, you’ll be standing on the top looking back down to where you started.   It’s the perfect mix of adventure and workout, where nature’s obstacles and terrain provide the challenge and the view from the top delivers the reward.</p>
<p>In the late ninety&#8217;s, my brother and I started making an annual trek back to our hometown to do a little camping and hiking.  It started out as a pretty casual event, with no real goals, other than to get out in the woods for some exercise, and spend time around the campfire.   After a couple years, a buddy of ours started hiking with us for what was soon to become an annual tradition.  It wasn&#8217;t too long before we learned about the Catskill 3500 Club and the 35 peaks above 3500’ that must be climbed to gain membership.   That’s when everything changed.   What was once a casual fall weekend had turned into mission to climb all 35 of the 3500’ Catskill Mountains.   With only 6 of the 35 peaks left, we can see the finish line.</p>
<p>Over the next few issues of Relatively Random, we’ll tell you about the peaks we’ve conquered and the things we’ve learned. We’ll talk a bit about the gear we’ve tried, what has worked, and what has not.</p>
<p>If this ‘peaks’ your interest, pun intended, check in next month as we talk about the Escarpment Trail.</p>

Like watchmen from towers, long-legged cranes and osprey welcome me to their coastal kingdom. Almost at once, humidity makes my skin sticky, my typically obedient hair takes on a wild curl, and a pleasant film of salt and sand coats my face. The ocean hides from me, but I can hear her voice on the other side of Topsail’s white sand dunes. Sea grass dances to her song. I follow a path over the sandbank and she is there, wearing sapphires and lace, her arms stretched wide, her waves pulling me in for an embrace. I rush to get reacquainted. I forget her clever games. How she tempts me to her, and pulls away. How she lunges upon me when I turn my back. How she spills her secrets at my feet and leaves me to makes sense of those secrets. It has been too long. Too long on the mainland. Too long in the hills. I wish that time would forget this place, maybe even with me here – tiny on the edge of the earth, greeting each sunrise, digging, discovering, nesting. Topsail is a treasure: sparkling with sea glass and shells, rich with silvery sand dollars and ebony sharks’ teeth, compounded with turtles’ nest and glimmering dolphins. She is a sanctuary full of life and wonder, and a friend I never want to leave.</p>
