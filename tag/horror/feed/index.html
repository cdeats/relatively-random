					<description><![CDATA[<p>My guilt has been building and I cannot take it. “It was me, okay?</p>

<p>“Hey! I’m Alice. It’s Riley, right?”
I smile.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That’s me!
It’s nice to meet you,” my date wraps her arms around my shoulders. I usually
don’t go for hugs on the first date but something about this girl makes me want
to open up and tell her all my secrets. I’ve never tried online dating before,
but it doesn’t seem as bad as people make it out to be. Or maybe I just got
lucky. I mean, she’s beautiful. Her curled blonde hair cascades down the open
back of her baby blue sundress. When she pulls out of our hug, I’m met with
eyes bluer than water so clear that you can see through to the ocean floor. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Sorry,” I
chuckle nervously as I realize I’m staring. She joins me in laughter as we both
sit down at the high-top table. Three tall candles rest on the glossy finish of
each table, being the only source of light in the whole restaurant. The small
flames cast a reddish glow with the maroon color of the walls, setting a very
intimate mood for a first date. I was unsure of the location as soon as I
arrived. Now, I have no choice but to make small talk in an attempt to lighten
the mood. “How are you?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A little
nervous, to be honest.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Me too! I
haven’t been on a first date in years.” <em>Why
did I say that?</em> <em>Great idea of a first
impression, Alice.</em> </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That’s
okay!” she says, “Let’s just get to know each other for now. Tell me about
yourself.” She must have seen the embarrassment on my face.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Okay, let
me think.” I try to come up with interesting things about my life but I’m
blanking on everything other than my breakup with Penelope. I’m on a first
date! She shouldn’t be on my mind. Should she?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, my
dad died a couple years ago. Just tell me the first thing that comes to mind! I
want to know everything,” Riley leans forward on her arms, giving me her full
attention. It’s a warm gesture, but it fails to rid me of my thoughts.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m sorry
for your loss,” I frown. “I was actually thinking about everything that went
down with my ex-girlfriend, Penelope. That’s a dark story.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Don’t be
afraid to share things with me! How long ago was your breakup?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A little
over a year ago.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Why did
you two end things?” Oh boy. Here it comes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That’s
where it gets dark. Are you sure you want to know?” I ask her, fearful of her
response.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Of course!
I have quite a few scary breakup stories myself.” If only she knew what was
coming.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Two years ago…</em></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Henry, our
one-year anniversary is coming up in a month. I have to get her something. But
what?”</p>



<p>“Maybe a necklace?” my best friend
suggests on the other end of the phone.</p>



<p>“I could make her a butterfly
necklace! I know she likes butterflies. I want it to be real, though, and diamonds
are really expensive. Can you make real diamonds?” I ask.</p>



<p>“I think they’re made of carbon?” he
says, his tone turning it into more of a question.</p>



<p>“Yeah. Google says carbon is found
in pretty much everything, even ashes. That’s interesting.” I get an idea.
“I’ll call you back,” I mutter and hang up the phone. I open a new tab on my
laptop and type “ashes into diamonds” into the search bar. Videos pop up
immediately and I find myself watching them until the sun goes down. I know how
I’m going to do it, but where will I get ashes? There <em>is </em>a cemetery down the street from my house&#8230; </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pull my
boots on, grab a black bag from the kitchen, and go outside to grab a shovel
from the greenhouse. When I step inside, my black and silver shovel is leaning
against a shelf full of succulents. As I hold the shovel in my hands, a pang of
guilt washes over me. Maybe I should think further into what I’m about to do. <em>No, </em>I think to myself, <em>Penelope and I have been dating for almost a
year. I have to do something special for her.</em> I grab hedge trimmers and
start running down the street. I don’t have much time to do this if I don’t
want to get caught. The gravel crunches under my feet and my pulse is in my
ears. The loud thrumming distracts me from my doubt.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon
arriving at the garden of death, I start searching for graves with the lumpiest
dirt covering the casket. Carbon resides in fresh corpses more prominently than
it does in old and decomposed ones. Squinting in the dark, I come to a
cross-shaped headstone that reads:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Charles S.</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Father, Brother, and Friend</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>He will be forever missed.</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I swiftly
look away after reading the last line. I can’t let this simple factor stop me
from achieving my goal. I thrust my shovel into the ground beneath me and jump
when I hear a stick snap behind me. I freeze, not wanting to be seen. Dread
fills every inch of my body as the thing comes closer. Its steps are quiet in
the fallen leaves, like it’s about to jump out and grab me. I can feel it right
behind me as beads of sweat form on my forehead. Right when my legs are about
to give out, something soft brushes up against my shin. I let out the breath I
was holding as I realize, <em>it was just a
cat.</em> A black cat to be exact. How fitting.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
digging up mounds and mounds of dirt, my jeans are brown and the top of a white
casket can be seen, even in the dark. I open the casket to reveal a man that
looks to be around 70 years old. His hair is white and he’s wearing a blue
button-up that’s tucked into black dress pants. I grab his wrists and pull as
hard as I can. It takes some force to lift his body out of the pit his casket
is in. Once above ground, I lay him down and grab my hedge trimmer. His body is
definitely too big for the bag I brought. The snap of his bones breaking under
the pressure of the large scissors echoes through the small cemetery. First his
arms are shoved into the plastic bag. Then, I cut his legs at the hip and right
below the knee. Thank God he was embalmed. Otherwise, there would be blood
everywhere and I don’t have time for that. </p>



<p>I don’t have it in me to snap his
neck. I leave his head on and tie the bag closed around his neck so I don’t
leave remnants of an old man around my neighborhood. I refill the hole with
dirt and start on my way home, now carrying 165 pounds of old man with me. I
have to take breaks every once in a while to rest my arms. I can’t carry 100
pounds, let alone 165, and I don’t want the gravel pathway to shred the thin
bag I’ve put him in.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get
home, I put Charles in the huge freezer attached to my fridge. He needs to stay
cool if I want his remains to be as valuable as possible. I pick up the phone
and dial Henry’s number.</p>



<p>“Alice?” His voice sounds raspy. He
must have been asleep.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hey! I
need a favor. Do you still work at the crematorium down the street?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yeah,
why?”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">✻✻✻</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear a
car door slam. I look out the window and see Henry’s red pickup truck parked in
my driveway. Since I don’t have a car, Henry drove here to help me take Charles
to the crematorium.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Where is
he?” He sounds nervous and tired.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In the
freezer over there,” I point towards the kitchen and follow him through the
hallway. He carries Charles to the bed of his truck and secures him with bungee
cords. Once we arrive, we park in the back of the crematorium.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m
sneaking you in, okay? There shouldn’t be anybody here since it’s so late at
night.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s only
10pm.” He gets out of the truck and heads to unlock the door before grabbing
Charles’ remains.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You’ve
got to be kidding me,” he groans.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What is
it?” What could possibly go wrong at a time like this. <em>Lots of things.</em></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I left my key in my office. I didn’t
have a closing shift or an opening one so I didn’t think I’d need it. I’m
sorry, Alice.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We can
pick the lock! I have some hairpins,” I say, reaching for the pins holding my
messy bun in place. My brown locks tumble down across my shoulders. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry
grabs the pins from my hand and frantically starts picking the lock, his hands
shaking. The only street lamp in sight shines just enough light to see the
keyhole.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right as
the lock clicks open, the streetlamp’s bulb flickers off, leaving us in
complete darkness. Henry and I both jump in surprise.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ll go
get the bag.” Henry stumbles toward the truck. I know he ran into it because a
loud thud is followed by some impolite words.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air
inside the crematorium inside is cold, much colder than outside, despite the
furnaces surrounding us. I flick the lightswitch on while Henry carries the
black bag into another room. This one is full of metal tables and unfolded
cardboard boxes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Take one
of those boxes and place it on the metal table over here,” he nods toward a
table against the wall. I do as I’m told and Henry sets Charles on the brown
surface. With an easy slice, the black bag is cut in half, revealing the pale,
chopped up body before us. Henry is quick to fold the cardboard box and place
the lid on. Thank goodness. The frown lines on Charles’ face were creeping me
out. </p>



<p>“Can you help me wheel him to the
furnace?” We roll the metal table into the first room. In front of every
furnace is a large rectangular hole that drops into a concrete ashtray below,
full of ashes. I could probably just use these. “Are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I just realized that there
are ashes already here,” I mumble, partially regretting my decision to dig up
an old man.</p>



<p>“Well, we can just use those if
you’d like.”</p>



<p>“No. I’ve already made it this far.
I don’t want to turn back now,” I decide.</p>



<p>“Okay. I’ll just close the door and
turn on the fire. It’ll take a few hours,” Henry informs me. Henry presses a
button to open the furnace. A metal door slides up and he pushes the cardboard
box into the space in front of us.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A few
hours? What if someone catches us?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We’ll be
fine. The whole city will be asleep in a few hours. Don’t worry. Wanna come
play chess with me while we wait?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Okay,” I
groan and roll my eyes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure
enough, the flames disappear and Henry heads to break up what’s left of Charles
with a large metal rod. He comes back with a black box full of ashes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That
should be enough for the diamond. Thank you so much for doing this, Henry. You
don’t understand how much this means to me. I know this is probably crazy, not
to mention against the law. But I trust that you’ll keep this to yourself,
yes?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I promise,
Alice, there’s no way I’m admitting to being an accomplice to this. I can’t
believe you even talked me into this. But I would do anything for you.” And
with that, he drives me home, making sure to lock the door again on his way
out.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">✻✻✻</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s the
day. The jewelry should arrive at any moment. Our anniversary was seven months
ago, but I discovered that it would take around eight months to make the
diamond. The company apologized for my loss, even though it wasn’t technically <em>my</em> loss, and they said they couldn’t put
my diamond in a necklace. I had them set it into a ring, instead. I hope she
likes it. With that thought, the doorbell rings.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ll get
it!” I shout to Penelope, who’s in the other room. The velvet box comes with a
note that says:</p>



<p><em>Dear Alice, </em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for purchasing this diamond ring. We’re glad to
have helped in the permanent remembrance of your loved one. </em></p>



<p><em>-Ashes to Diamonds x</em></p>



<p>How sweet. “I have to ask you
something, Penny.” I say as I walk into the living room. Her strawberry blonde
hair is tied in a bun with little twirls coming down on her face. She looks so
perfect while reading <em>Frankenstein</em>,
her favorite book.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looks
up at me with golden-brown eyes and smiles. “What is it?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I need you
to stand.” And with that, she does, leaving the dog-eared book on the couch. I
kneel. “I’ve known you for two years now and there isn’t one thing I don’t love
about you. I love the way your hair curls when you get out of the shower. I
love the way you smile and wipe your tears after watching <em>The Notebook</em> for the millionth time. I love the way you’re always
so interested in the news. I love your compassion for people. The list could go
on forever. But, most of all, I love the way you look at me as if I’m the only
girl in the whole world. I want you to look at me that way forever. Penelope
Irene Bell, will you do me the honor of being my wife?” </p>



<p>I pull out the box and open it. A
diamond ring sits in the middle of the box. Her eyes are wet now, leaving
trails of tears down her cheeks. She covers her face in her hands and, for a
second, I’m not sure if those are tears of joy. I hear a muffled “yes” before
she nods her head frantically and kneels down to wrap me in her arms.</p>



<p>She crawls back and holds out her
left hand for me to slide the ring on her finger. It fits perfectly. The sun
coming in through the sheer, white curtains makes the diamond glisten. </p>



<p>For the next few days, all Penelope
talks about is the wedding. She spends her days looking through newspapers and
wedding magazines. A few months ago, she told me about a news story she read.
The grounds keeper at a cemetery found a black and silver shovel, along with
hedge trimmers, by the grave of a seventy-year-old man. My guilt kicked in
immediately. Every Sunday, she would tell me about another detail the cops had
found. There were no fingerprints. The casket was filled with dirt. The family
hasn’t even claimed him. With every new detail she tells me comes another wave
of breath-taking guilt. Now that I’ve proposed, I don’t know what to do.</p>



<p>We’re both sitting at the glass
table when she looks up from her newspaper and says, “The cops still haven’t
found the culprit. Nobody saw who did it or knows who it could be. Who could do
such a thing? That poor family, and they don’t even know,” her tone is full of
sympathy. </p>



<p>After staring into her brown eyes
for a while, I can’t take it anymore. I’ve thought about this every day since
the cremation. My guilt has been building and I cannot take it. “It was me,
okay? I robbed that man’s grave. There, I confessed. Every single day for the
past eight months has been so torturous for me. And you following this story
has only made it more difficult. But I did this all for you!” I thrust my hand
in her direction. “Where do you think that diamond came from? I know you found
the note on the counter after I proposed.”</p>



<p>She stares at me in silence. Her
hand brushes through her hair as she tries to process this information. “How—
how could you? I don’t understand. That’s absolutely disgusting! What were you
thinking? I love you more than words can express, but this is too much. I don’t
even want to know, Alice. It’s over.” And before I can protest or explain
myself, she slips her shoes on and bolts out the door.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>In the present…</em></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Wow. What
kind of person would steal a man from his grave? I mean, seriously. What was
that? And then to use his ashes to propose to your girlfriend? That’s
disgusting!” Riley scoffs.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It was all
for Penelope. But it’s in the past now. She dumped me and I have no idea where
she is. I haven’t seen her since.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That guy
had a name! Charles had a name! Do you even know what his last name was? Or
were you too blind with your crazy ideas to look?” Her cold gaze moves from me
to the candles, which are now halfway melted.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “His name
was Charles Stewart,” I mumble into my water glass before taking a sip.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riley gasps
and the color fades from her cheeks. “Wait. Charles M. Stewart?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yeah, I
think so. Why?” I ask, now confused.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That’s my
father’s name.”</p>The post <a href="/2020/04/jewelry-that-costs-an-arm-and-a-leg-a-gothic-narrative/">Jewelry That Costs an Arm and a Leg: A Gothic Narrative</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
