										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend Corey and I started riding motorcycles back in 1979.   In those days, my motorcycle of choice, where choice was defined by the $175 I had in my bank account, was a 1972 Honda SL70 with Corey riding a 1974 Suzuki TS75.   Two machines perfectly equipped to provide hours of adventure in old farm fields, on makeshift motocross tracks, and Catskill Mountain logging trails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward nearly 30 years, and once again, you&#8217;d find Corey and I loading up our current motorcycles of choice with enough gear to get us through a weekend of riding adventure.  Whether the destination was the Adirondack Mountains, the Finger Lakes, New England, or the Atlantic Ocean, the fun factor was still as high as it was back in the 70&#8217;s.   As the ride distance grew, and the days on the bikes increased, there was a continual search for the perfect motorcycle (or the perfect seat).  One that would provide multi-day riding comfort, capacity for all our gear, and enough power and handling prowess to tackle all the climbs and the twisties that would be thrown at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several bike purchases in search of the best do-it-all motorcycle&#8230;.we both ended up landing on BMW&#8217;s.   Corey riding a current era F800GT and me on a decade and a half old R1100S.   Both being completely able handle the task of tight twisties, high speed sweepers, placing &#8216;slower traffic&#8217; clearly in the rear view mirrors, all while providing a level of comfort that enables a 350 mile riding day without the need for medical attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve wanted to ride the Blue Ridge Parkway ever since I was first introduced to it a few years ago down in Meadows of Dan, VA.   The twists and turns and the outstanding views seemed like a perfect motorcycle road.   Being located in upstate NY, the &#8216;getting there&#8217; seemed like an ominous undertaking on the bikes I&#8217;ve owned in the past.   With my ‘new to me’ Beemer, things did not seem so scary.   A quick email to Corey confirmed that he was game too&#8230;   The planning had begun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had four days of riding to make this thing happen.  Given a desire to make it about 120 miles down the Blue Ridge, we had a total of 1100 or so miles to cover in those 4 days.  Other than that, the only planning stipulations were no four lane highways, lots of curves, and lodging close to sources of good food at the end of each day.   Corey started out a day ahead of time to get from his home in the Catskills to my home near Rochester.   The next morning, with the bikes washed and prepped, the saddle bags loaded, and the GPS programmed, we were ready.</span></p>

<p>Day one took us from Rochester, NY to Berkeley Springs, WV, covering some great roads in New York and Pennsylvania.   As we entered into Pennsylvania, a nice grandmotherly lady at a convenient mart warned us of recent Moose sightings.   Knowing the size of a Moose and the size of my motorcycle, hitting a Moose seemed like a bad option&#8230;so I proceeded with caution and with every intention to try to duck under any Moose I encountered along the way.   PA Routes 49, 872, and 53 offered up some outstanding, and moose free, riding and were the definite highlight of the day’s 300 miles.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a motorcyclist or have a fun handling car parked in your garage and are looking for a place to use up a bit more of your steering, suspension, and tire tread… the Blue Ridge Parkway should be on your list of roads to drive before your driving days are over.</span></p>
