										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When his name was announced<br />
What the silence pronounced<br />
Was the soul of the Sabbath Day crowd</p>
<p>They had come here to see<br />
The last game he would be<br />
In the uniform he wore so proud</p>
<p>He had played twenty years<br />
Through the boos and the cheers<br />
With a thirst, and a love for the game</p>
<p>He would send them away<br />
Filled with awe and dismay<br />
They could see what had earned him his fame</p>
<p>When he’d step to the plate<br />
How his chest would inflate<br />
With the crowd like the wind at his back</p>
<p>He knew what to do<br />
With whatever they threw<br />
When to take, when to give it a whack</p>
<p>He would focus his eyes<br />
His selection was wise<br />
There was steel in his arms when he swung</p>
<p>They were drawn to this place<br />
To watch his style and grace<br />
When they rose it was his praise was sung</p>
<p>This was his church, it’s true<br />
And you sat is his pew<br />
When you came out to watch this man play</p>
<p>He was surely to blame<br />
This was more than a game<br />
What spit had been mixed with his clay?</p>
<p>He had played 20 years<br />
And had earned every cheer<br />
In his mind he still had his youth</p>
<p>But the young hurlers knew<br />
By the pitches they threw<br />
That his body was feeling the truth</p>
<p>Here he’d dove for a ball<br />
There he’d run in the wall<br />
He’d been pitched at, he’d slid hard, he’d run</p>
<p>When his legs were too sore<br />
When his ligaments tore<br />
Still he played, till the season was done</p>
<p>Now he stood at the plate<br />
Contemplating his fate<br />
As the pitcher stood staring him down</p>
<p>“Don’t worry old bum”<br />
Boldly these words had come<br />
From the catcher, who spat on the ground</p>
<p>“It isn’t my call<br />
But he’ll throw you four balls<br />
That’s the way that they want it today.</p>
<p>You are big in this town<br />
But I think you’re a clown<br />
It’s a disgrace they still let you play”</p>
<p>As he walked down to first<br />
He remembered the thirst<br />
That he always had had for this game</p>
<p>Although out of respect<br />
A walk didn’t reflect<br />
Why they’d come here to honor his name</p>
<p>But he’d no time to stew<br />
The next drive went on through<br />
To the wall and he started to run</p>
<p>As past second he ran<br />
He caught sight of the man<br />
Out in center, “man he’s got a gun”</p>
<p>But he bobbled the ball<br />
Played it bad off the wall<br />
And he’d been here often before</p>
<p>He would challenge the play<br />
And he’d make that man pay<br />
If they waved him on in he would score</p>
<p>Once he ran like the wind<br />
Now the legs would not bend<br />
Still he gave it the best that he had</p>
<p>When he rounded third base<br />
You could see in his face<br />
The fervor he had as a lad</p>
<p>As the coach waves him in<br />
He’s urged on by the din<br />
But too late he knows with a gasp</p>
<p>With his spirit strong<br />
He’d excited the throng<br />
But his reach had exceeded his grasp</p>
<p>These last months that he’d spent<br />
On the bench to repent<br />
For his failings brought on by his age</p>
<p>Had prepared him to fail<br />
Striving to no avail<br />
But his heart was igniting a rage</p>
<p>He had not played this long<br />
To have this his swan song<br />
To be mocked by that boy at the plate</p>
<p>They were blocking him wide<br />
Trying to force a slide<br />
Just in case that the ball got there late</p>
<p>They knew with his knee<br />
It’s the wrong place to be<br />
He would have to reach back with his hand</p>
<p>The tag, they were sure<br />
The out would insure<br />
His hourglass was now out of sand</p>
<p>The catcher reached out<br />
For the ball as a shout<br />
From the crowd said they knew he was done</p>
<p>He’d given his best<br />
But he’d failed this last test<br />
He would never deliver this run</p>
<p>He could feel the knee give<br />
And his reason to live<br />
Would be gone when the ump made his call</p>
<p>It was anguish he felt<br />
As hope started to melt<br />
When he heard the loud ‘pop’ of the ball</p>
<p>There guarding the plate<br />
Like St. Peter’s gate<br />
Stood the catcher a sneer on his face</p>
<p>“Old man you’ve had your day<br />
Now it’s your time to pay<br />
You’re too old to handle the pace”</p>
<p>He could not hear the crowd<br />
For his heart beat too loud<br />
As for one final slide he prepared</p>
<p>The catcher bent down<br />
His plight to compound<br />
The ump stooped to see how he fared</p>
<p>He’d be stripped of his pride<br />
At the end of this slide<br />
His career would end in defeat</p>
<p>With the last of his strength<br />
He extended full length<br />
And his dive tore his foe from his feet</p>
<p>The crowd stood to a man<br />
Now one unified fan<br />
And their roar his salvation pronounced</p>
<p>The umps arms spread wide<br />
The catcher lay on his side<br />
And grabbed for the ball as it bounced</p>
<p>Slowly he rose<br />
There was blood on his nose<br />
And the pain in his knee was intense</p>
<p>He should have been proud<br />
As he waved to the crowd<br />
His legacy now was immense</p>
<p>But the man simply turned<br />
To the catcher who’d spurned<br />
This ancient, decrepit old man</p>
<p>For a moment he gazed<br />
At the hand that was raised<br />
With their shake they said all a man can</p>
<p>His career now was through<br />
To this game he’d been true<br />
For his sins he’d atoned here today</p>
<p>They were still in their seats<br />
In reverence of this feat<br />
By the man they had come to watch play</p>
<p>His teammates just stood<br />
For they felt that they should<br />
Let him walk all alone from the field</p>
<p>This game takes its toll<br />
Here he’d given his soul<br />
His redemption, refusing to yield</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/04/the-deacon/">The Deacon</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Springtime in the mountains can be a bit elusive. Despite the date shown on the calendar, winter often keeps a firm grasp, with snowpack clinging to the high peaks long into April, but as kids, as if we could coax a change in seasons, we’d get the bikes out, get the baseball gear out, and do our best to experience spring.</p>
<p>Our small mountain town was nestled in a valley along the banks of a picturesque stream. Starting high in the mountains, small tributaries would spring from the earth and make their way to the valley floor, joining forces to form the Batavia Kill. Not only was this a source of water for the Big Apple, just a couple hours downstream, but it also served as the perfect playground for the neighborhood kids. Much like the mighty Mississippi was the perfect backdrop for the adventures of Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer, the Batavia Kill was the birthplace of many of the adventures of childhood, but probably the most anticipated adventure each year, was the first day of trout season.</p>
<p>With a rocky creek bed, a path that meanders through the valley at times cutting deep in the banks that contain it, and pools both shallow and deep, a native brook trout would be hard pressed to find a more perfect habitat&#8230;and we knew that. So, as March started to come to a close, the excitement for April first, trout season’s opening day, grew with each passing day.</p>
<p>Planning started early. First was the matter of gear. Yes, my trusty Zebco 202 was propped up in the corner of the garage, exactly where I had set it the October prior. But what about hook, line, and sinker&#8230;was I properly equipped? The bait of choice was the trusty night crawler or garden worm; however, winter’s deep freeze often did not relent in time to go that route, and lures often were the only option. Next on the list of things to decide on was the location&#8230;and there were several to choose from. Where would we head opening day? Would it be the catfish hole, named for that one and only catfish ever caught in the slow moving current beneath the damp bank of a neighboring cornfield. Maybe we should go to the stumps, or the spillway, or even Davis’ rock. All fine choices, providing equal opportunity to catch that perfect spring Brook Trout, if Grandpa or Uncle Lem did not beat us to it.</p>
<p>The final detail was just down to opening day logistics. A lot of years have passed since those days back in the mountains, but I don’t remember an opening day that ever fell on a weekend&#8230;it had to, but all my memories of this day involved a school bus ride to school, a long day of anticipation, a school bus ride home that felt like it took an eternity, and a mad sprint to get our fishing gear so we could hit the stream before daylight made an early exit. We’d ride our bikes down to Willy’s barn, just to ditch them and head upstream by foot to get to our chosen fishing hole.</p>
<p>Daylight is often scarce in the early spring, and even more scarce in the valley, as the sun would hide away behind the mountains long before it officially set for the evening. We’d stretch every minute out of it that we could. Cast after cast&#8230;proclaiming the news of every nibble, both real and imagined, and we’d all secretly hope to be the first one to catch a trout that season. It didn’t matter if the air was cold or even if the snow was still falling. It didn’t even matter if we caught a fish that day. This was spring in the mountains, the opening day of trout season, the moment we’d been waiting for to officially kick off the next season of longer days and warmer afternoons. A more perfect moment could not be created.</p>
<p>I imagine we all have our mental images of what heaven looks like&#8230;but I think there is a corner in heaven where there runs a small mountain creek, and by that creek are two boys, fishing poles in hand, standing on a bank wearing winter boots and unzipped sweatshirts, watching with anticipation as their fishing line floats down stream, waiting for the moment when they feel a tug&#8230;and their line drifts no more.</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/04/opening-day/">Opening Day</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
