										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not your typical “grieving teacher” post. Trust me, I have grieved. Hard.</p>



<p>&#8230;but today, I reported to my classroom for the first time since March 12, 2020. It’s almost time to close up shop for the summer.</p>



<p>As I approached the doorway, I couldn’t help but notice the “Pandemic Cleaning Checklist” that hung on the door. I pulled my mask down so I could anxiously exhale and clearly view the steps our custodians took to make the environment safe. Then, I turned the key and entered.</p>



<p>Everything else was just as we had left it. The setting was eerie, in mildly post-apocalyptic way.</p>



<p>Lucas’ handwriting greeted me from the whiteboard — in bold purple marker, it reminded me of his campaign to be my favorite student.</p>



<p>Our field trip bus request and permission forms peeked out of a yellow folder I had prepared for an upcoming special event I had planned with some of my teacher soul-sisters from other districts.</p>



<p>A few leftover Class of 2020 t-shirt order forms puddled up on a student desk near mine.</p>



<p>I quickly sprayed the markerboard and wiped it clean. I tossed the order forms and the field trip folder into the trash. Many other stacks and bundles followed. I purge. It’s what I do to put the past in the past.</p>



<p>For over six weeks, I have maintained communication and connection strictly through digital means. I have driven past homes, honking and waving at precious friends in their yards and I have briefly chatted with my parents in their driveway when I dropped off supplies.</p>

<p>Folks, it is not the same. You can see the proof in the photo on the left. That woman has had limited real human interaction for the last month.</p>



<p>Do you see the fear in her eyes?<br>Do see the darkness?</p>



<p>Now look at the face on the right. That face is relaxed, smiling, and glowing. That is the face of a teacher who is back in her element, hitting reset, reflecting, and making plans for the future. It’s the countenance of a woman who spent just a few minutes chatting eye to eye with colleagues in the high school hallways. These images were taken just a couple of healing hours apart. Clearly, face-to-face interaction is a steroid, and we all need a shot.</p>



<p>I am not mourning any longer.<br>Our students are going to be okay.<br>We are going to be okay.</p>



<p>We have to allow ourselves to be.</p>



<p>Ready yourself to overcome this.<br>Plan to put the past in the past.<br>Prepare to purge the fear.<br>Get ready to glow!!</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2020/04/ready-set-glow/">Ready, Set, Glow</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
