										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was with great anticipation that we waited for tonight, the opening of Disney’s latest release, Beauty and the Beast. A tale as old as time, Beauty and the Beast is back on the big screen this weekend, this time in a live-action format. As we have come to expect from Disney Studios, the film’s gorgeous costumes, its breath-taking sets, delightful special effects, and its current themes are certain to appeal to modern moviegoers.</p>
<p>Disney piqued our curiosity through social media. We first learned of this adaptation through Facebook trailers that used a split-screen method to show viewers key scenes from the 1991 classic and the 2017 overhaul, and we sentimentally fell intrigued with the intentional similarities. We were interested to see how the animated version we knew would translate to the live-action format. Would the dinner plates perform in Technicolor brilliance? Would the beast be realistic enough to fear … and to love? Would Gaston be as irresistible in human form as he thinks he is in Animation Land? (To our delight, Gaston, played by Luke Evans – Fast and Furious 6, 2013; Girl on the Train, 2016 – can SING, though we still dislike the character as much as we did in 1991.)</p>
<p>After our enjoyable experience with the recent Cinderella remake, we trusted that this film would measure up, or even surpass its predecessor.</p>
<p>We entered the sold-out theatre on opening night. Our expectations were high. Instantly, we were captivated by a flashback that shows the prince (before the spell) entertaining at a ball that makes bibliophiles like Belle think of Edgar Allan Poe’s “Masque of the Red Death.” It’s dark and ominous, symbolizing the joyless life the prince lives even before he transforms. Soon, the flashback melts away, and we are in the present setting, enchanted and singing along with the familiar lines of the opening song. Fans will know the words. (Oh, and there are a handful of other literary allusions that will make your high school English teacher proud.)</p>
<p>The movie remained consistent for several scenes, and that was satisfactory for us, but Disney must have anticipated that some audiences would appreciate something original with the “remake.” Thus, they incorporated a story unexplored in the animation – the backstory of Belle’s mother. (Rarely do we see a mother figure in a Disney story line. Have you noticed this too?) Viewers will appreciate this explanation and the more developed and sympathetic character that is her father.</p>
<p>As a mother and teacher, I first thought of the one of the strongest themes of this plot: “Don’t judge one by his or her appearance.” Yes! We certainly can’t argue with the importance of that message, and this adaptation delivered on that point, but it provides more. Feminists will be pleased to see Belle is the inventor in this version, not her father. (Wait until you see what she engineers!) Disney offers a new dimension, a modern message for the young women in the audience: There is so much more for you than just what you have planned for yourself. This lesson, along with others about how to behave when others mock you make this movie one to share with young women. Additionally, the key scene when Belle climbs the bluff to “the great wide somewhere” is more than just literal.</p>
<p>Viewers will also appreciate a new understanding to His Royalty’s roar. He’s not just having a bad fur day.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this film is good. We sang, we laughed, we reminisced, and (we admit) we cried more than just a few quiet tears due to its heartbreaking undercurrent of homesickness. We think it will make a good film for your family to share this weekend. Its PG rating is due to the scary moments you may remember from the animation – creepy woods, aggressive wolves, a fight scene at the resolution. Additionally, if you’ve read other reviews, you realize you may have to field some questions about the relationship between LeFou and some of the other characters, but the tendencies may be ambiguous enough to sneak past young viewers. We encourage each of you to take this issue into consideration. Furthermore, the notion that a person needs somebody else to complete him or free him from some sort of captivity is somewhat perturbing, but the movie offered us more enjoyment than disappointment. Thus, we invite you to “be our guest” and spend a little time with Beauty and her beast.</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-a-review-of-this-disney-remake/">Beauty and the Beast – A review of this Disney remake</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/02/is-the-choice-the-best-choice-for-valentines-day/">Is The Choice the best choice for Valentine’s Day?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentine’s Day takes place this weekend, and with it comes the very awkward obligation to spend time, spend money, and expend effort, all in the name of “love.” It’s the quintessential “Darned If You Do, Darned If You Don’t” hallmark, and we at Relatively Random have done a little research to make your Valentine’s Day … less … um … darned.</p>
<p>First, we considered the traditional dinner and a movie date format. Luckily, Lionsgate has released a new Nicholas Sparks’ movie just in time for the blessed day! Like the holiday, however, The Choice is a complicated option for your romantic celebration, but here is why we like it:</p>
<p>1. Flirting Lessons: If you and your sweetheart are just starting your romantic journey, the adorable bantering between the film’s lead characters will give you a clever example. The first half of the show is filled with witty jabs and cute phrases that show viewers how to be playful and polite, how to make friends and how to make up. If you’re further down the road in your relationship, however, this story is a good one for you, as well. While you may have mastered the art of flirting years ago, this reel will give you the refresher you might not even know you need. Wink, wink. Truthfully, this film is great for the non-committed viewer, too, as both of the primary actors (Benjamin Walker, Teresa Palmer) are so attractive and compelling, you’ll feel like they are flirting with you. (I certainly got my money’s worth.) Thus, this film is an option for couples and unattached audiences to enjoy.</p>
<p>2. It’s a terrible book-to-screen adaptation. This means that if your date has already read the 2007 novel upon which this movie is based, she’ll actually get a big surprise. The movie is very different from the book. (We enjoyed the movie more, actually, which pains us to say. Aren’t we always supposed to claim that the book is better than its silver screen account?) Gabby (Warm Bodies, Point Break 2015) is more believably brought to life on screen, and more likable. The storyline is essentially the same – boy meets girl, boy is smitten, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, boy loses girl again (this time in a more dramatic way) – but it contains enough plot variance and difference in character development to make the two stand alone. Therefore, the price of admission will be a good investment; the movie will provide you with something you weren’t expecting (if you were expecting a true-to-text representation).</p>
<p>3. North Carolina. Like every other Sparks’ film we’ve seen, The Choice is set on the banks of North Carolina, and this one celebrates the waterways that flow between the mainland and the open sea. It is full of beautiful landscape shots, images of coastal activities such as fishing, boating, and picnics, and tours of unique waterfront properties. In this film, it is warm and sunny (except for some scenes where bad weather symbolizes crisis to promote the movie’s climax) and for that reason, we recommend spending a frigid February evening or wintery weekend afternoon in the theatre. Take a little vacation to the coast with this piece of cinema.<br />

<p>4. It’s grown-up. The Choice carries with it mature and complex themes. It’s not just a love story, it makes some philosophical and morale claims, as well. Viewers will notice a voice-over narrative about choices and life’s direction. They’ll also find religious undertones and implications about the importance of tradition and the value of family, and it will be impossible to ignore the blatant message: “Love harder.” So, if you’re not in the mood for a chick flick, step up to the ticket window anyway. This movie offers more than just the cliché tropes of a romantic drama.</p>
<p>Overall, we enjoyed the film. While it does not receive rave reviews from other entertainment reporters, we found The Choice to be more than what we expected and rate it a good choice for Valentine’s viewing. (Note: We do not recommend this as a choice for a first date. There will be crying, and if you’re uncomfortable with showing emotion as your friendship forms, skip this one. Besides, is there any good way to warn your date that she might need to wear waterproof mascara when she goes out with you? That might sound like a bad omen. And is it really fair to ask her to cry off all of her concealer, like we did? I mean, she barely knows you! She probably isn’t ready to bare her whole heart and her naked face, too.)</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2016/02/is-the-choice-the-best-choice-for-valentines-day/">Is The Choice the best choice for Valentine’s Day?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Disney's new girl presents old-fashioned values</p>
The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2015/03/cinderella-2015-movie-review/">Cinderella 2015 Movie Review</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most well-known tales of our time, <em>Cinderella</em>, is back on the big screen this weekend, and Walt Disney Studios expects huge audiences. In true Disney fashion, its stunning costumes, its larger-than-life sets and well-crafted effects, and its current themes are certain to attract many moviegoers.</p>
<p>As an adult, I wanted to see the film because of its classic appeal. Don’t we all have some connection to this story? We know it well. I remember performing in an elementary school musical production of the story. (I played a <em>mouse</em>.)</p>
<p>… but it was more than that.</p>
<p>I first learned of this adaptation through social media, and I followed the link provided on my timeline to see a movie trailer that captivated me. I was interested to see how the animated version I knew translated to the live-action format. The costumes &#8212; Oh, that DRESS! – and the hint at the conflict suggested that THIS Cinderella is a girl for the modern female consumer. And then, after researching the film a bit more, I discovered the pleasant blend of veteran and fresh talent. Experienced actors such Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter work will with new names, and, as a <em>Downton Abbey</em> fan, I was very pleased to see Lily James portray the title character. (<em>Downton</em> fans, watch for another familiar face in this film.)</p>
<p>There was no doubt; I would see <em>Cinderella</em> on opening day. And I did.</p>
<p>I went in excited, but cautious – would this version deliver a healthy message? Would it seduce me to buy in to the impossible idea of a fairy tale? Within moments, I knew that all the parts of me – the parent, the teacher, the woman &#8212; approved of one of its themes: “Have courage and be kind.”</p>
<p>I first thought of the young women in the audience. Yes! This film was made with you in mind. It doesn’t desire to sell you an unattainable romantic notion; it intends to inspire you to hold on to the goodness that IS you. Whether you identify with the aggressors, the victim, or something in the middle, Cinderella highlights the violence of mean girls and shows an average young woman’s resilience in the face of brutal bullies. The story also illustrates the transformative power of words, name-calling, and labeling. THIS is NOT fiction. Tell a person she is ash, and she’ll become ash, low and filthy. Tell her she is a princess and she will rise up, confident and powerful. “Preach, Disney, Preach,” I wanted to cheer. THIS is a message to sell to the masses. It’s not just the Fairy Godmother’s magic that can transform a “wretch” into a beautiful belle; we each possess that very real power.</p>
<p>Additionally, the horrid stepsisters demonstrate a great lesson on perspective. I won’t spoil it for you, but watch for it. As true “haters,” they find a way to taint a special memory Cinderella treasures. I hope viewers notice this scene and think about how to protect their hearts from bitterness like this.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this film is beauty, sparkle, and special effects that mirror the beauty and sparkle we can magically offer when we are kind to others.</p>
<p>If this isn’t reason enough to view the film, observe it for the gorgeous gowns and fantastic sets, the terrific soundtrack, the incredible horse-drawn carriage, and for goodness sake, the shoes. Go see it for the shoes!</p>
<p>… or if you choose not to see the film, I forgive you, because that is another lesson I learned from this fierce-feministic Cinderella. Have courage, be kind, and forgive.</p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2015/03/cinderella-2015-movie-review/">Cinderella 2015 Movie Review</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>
