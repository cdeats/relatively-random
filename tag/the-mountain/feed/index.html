										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Echoed footsteps reverberated off the stone walls and marble floors. The measured pace an agonized pounding that was nearly enough to drive Dylan mad. He watched helplessly as their captor strode back and forth before them. His stature was unimposing, but the surety he carried himself with could only come from a sense of assured power and invincibility. The features of his face possessed both a beauty and a severity. There was no softness, no gentleness, no mercy present at all. Only an unrelenting that bordered on harshness. It was clear to Dylan that whatever he was, he wasn’t human. No soul could be present behind those black eyes. The petulant smile plastered to the monster’s face was the only thing more infuriating than his incessant footfalls.</p>
<p>The idea they were defeated wasn’t something Dylan was willing to accept. There had to be a way out. He couldn’t see one at the moment, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t one. He couldn’t communicate with Dinah either. There were so many men focused on them it was impossible to engage her without drawing someone’s immediate attention. He snuck a glance at his cousin from the corner of his eye and was shocked by what he saw.</p>
<p>Dinah showed no sign of concern despite their current situation. She stood confidently, her hands on her hips. There was a gleam in her eye that told Dylan she had a plan. In all the years they had known each other, Dinah had never been a good poker player. She wore her emotions on her sleeve, making it nearly impossible for her to bluff. Dylan prayed that was true in this instance as well. The wrong move would certainly cost them their lives.</p>
<p>“I have worked a long time for this moment. My master will be greatly pleased with me. Your capture has been his foremost goal,” the ghoul in a suit gushed confidently.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so certain of that” Dinah almost laughed as she spoke, ”You’re assuming it was your master who ordained this. What makes you think it wasn’t mine?”</p>
<p>The pacing ceased as the demon, Abbadon, turned to fully face Dinah and Dylan. He considered the strength in her stance for a moment, and the triumph faded from his face. He had expected their fear to be palpable, and yet here was this child, for all intents and purposes, denying him his moment of glory and revelry.</p>
<p>“You’re right when you call me a child. I am a child of the Great I Am. It is you who should be afraid.” Dinah spoke with such authority that her words struck like a braided whip.</p>
<p>Abbadon hissed as he realized Dinah had read his thoughts. His master had not prepared him for this.</p>
<p>“Of course he hasn’t prepared you for this! He couldn’t prepare you to win a victory you have already lost. I almost feel pity for you.” Dinah’s eyes raked up and down the demon’s frame, which seemed to visibly diminish under the weight of her spoken truth.</p>
<p>“What is this?! It is I who have trapped you! How do you have this power? To be inside my mind! I will destroy you!” Rage erupted from the fear roiling in the mind of the fallen angel.</p>
<p>Dylan reached out and grabbed Dinah’s hand. He wasn’t convinced yet that Dinah really knew what she was doing. His intent was to caution her but, the moment his skin touched hers, he felt a surge of power unlike anything he had ever experienced before. His fear vanished, replaced by the absolute assurance that comes from being one of the chosen children of God Almighty.</p>
<p>“You have no power over us! We are no longer slaves to fear!” Dylan stepped forward as he spoke, his eyes blazing.</p>
<p>All over the room, guns trained in on Dylan, ready to fire at Abbadon’s command. Before he could give the order however, Dinah raised her voice so even the men in the very back could hear her.</p>
<p>“Fear not! We are not your enemy. The one who commands us loves you, and wants nothing more than for you to be restored to him. Lay down your weapons! You are forgiven!” Her palms thrust forward on the word “forgiven” and a great rushing wind burst forth in every direction. The men were buffeted about by the blast and could barely keep their balance. Hushed voices washed over the three figures in the center of the room as the men were released from Abbadon’s influence and returned to themselves. All over the room, men lowered their weapons and fell to their knees.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?! Get up you fools! She is nothing!! I am the one who commands you!” Abbadon screeched at the men in desperation</p>
<p>“You have no power here demon.” Dylan closed in with clenched fists.</p>
<p>Abbadon glared back warily as his adversary stalked him. “I am the King of the Pit! This world was given to me by my master! I am not to be trifled with, boy!” He spat the last word as an insult, but Dylan merely grinned back, not slowing his pace at all.</p>
<p>“I won’t trifle with you. I will deal with you exactly as you deserve to be dealt with.” Dylan closed the gap with one more stride and grabbed the demon by the lapels of his designer suit. In one swift movement, Dylan threw the creature against one of the great stone pillars in the foyer. “There is only one King. The one who has called me has the power here. Can you see that now? Should I speak His name? Will that convince you?”</p>
<p>“No!” Abbadon cowered against the cold marble. All semblance of his former confidence having evaporated beneath Dylan’s fiery glare. Even the men who still surrounded them shrank back. Many were trying to gather their bearings and come to grips with the new reality, that their leader was no longer who they wanted to follow.</p>
<p>Dinah put her hand gently on her cousin’s shoulder, a quiet request for restraint implied by the touch. Once again, power flowed into Dylan, but this time it called him to peace instead of action. He inhaled deeply, centering his focus on who he belonged to.</p>
<p>“I want you to deliver a message to your master,” Dinah’s voice was calm, implying no imminent threat.</p>
<p>“Am I to be your errand boy now?” Abbadon hissed derisively.</p>
<p>“You can convey our message, or you can be the message. It’s up to you.” This time there was no mistaking the danger in her still, even tone.</p>
<p>“What would you have me say?” The demon knew he was in no position to argue.</p>
<p>“The One who was, and is, and is to come, has claimed this world as His own, and there is nothing that can separate us from Him. No matter what your master has planned, he will fail. The victory was won over two thousand years ago. You are both destined to return to the pit you are so proud to rule over. For eternity.”</p>
<p>Dinah could see the fear in Abbadon’s eyes. Despite his claims of dominion, he wanted to be free of the pit. He wanted to rule on Earth, not under it. Even his basic nature was to want to draw closer to the Creator’s creation.</p>
<p>“You know I speak the truth. Now go and speak that same truth to your master. Remind him who the Conqueror truly is! In Jesus’ Name!”</p>
<p>The moment Dinah spoke the savior’s name a tremendous crack resounded through the building and the marble foyer opened like a great maw to swallow Abbadon. Sheer panic reigned over the hardened warriors surrounding the cousins as the former temple of worldly knowledge shuddered and began to crumble around them. Their screams mixed with the thunder of falling stone as they tried to escape.</p>
<p>Dylan grabbed Dinah’s hand and she could sense his fear. Without stopping to think about what she was doing, she pushed the peace she felt in her soul outward from herself to cover Dylan as well. Immediately his hand relaxed in hers, despite the chaos that rained down, quite literally, around them. She knew there was no way she could explain what was happening within her, or how she was able to do what she had been doing. Dinah just knew that faith was the key, and as long as she trusted in Him things would work out exactly as they were meant to. She need only follow The Light.</p>
<p>Dust billowed up from the building’s collapse as Dylan and Dinah stood in the center of it. A moment before Dylan was wracking his brain for any possible escape route, squinting through the choking cloud that engulfed them. The noise nearly overwhelming him all on its own. Then Dinah’s hand was squeezing his and his fear vanished. As though she knew what he had been searching for, she raised her other arm and pointed. Dylan turned in the direction Dinah indicated. Light blazed through the tumult and beckoned to them. In unison they obeyed its call.</p>The post <a href="/2017/10/obedience/">Obedience</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="/2017/05/shepherd/">Shepherd</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peace settled on the clearing in a nearly physical way. Its contrast to the violence of the events that had just taken place was stark. Isaac stood at the very edge of the clearing, where he had dispersed his father’s ashes what seemed like a lifetime ago. He was able to survey the entire valley from the overlook. Isaac had grown up in the desert of Arizona surrounded by some incredible panoramas, but the view before him now was breathtaking. It gave him cause to reflect and simply admire creation’s splendor. The appreciation he felt reminded him of a memory. It was not his memory though. Never the less, its clarity could not be denied. He knew it did not belong to him, yet somehow it had found its way into his conscious mind.</p>
<p>In this vision, a spectacular garden stretched out before him. Lush plants of every kind blossomed and bloomed, vibrant colors exploding from their petals. Succulent fruit trees, with branches bowing under the weight of their abundant harvest, gave shade to all manner of creature both great and small. Birds dressed in the most beautiful plumage imaginable soared above him. The call of a multitude of beasts rang out through the valley below. Their chorus almost melodic. Isaac breathed in the heady scent of lilac coupled with citrus. Each inhaled breath revived his spirit and every exhale cleansed all the impurity from his soul.</p>
<p>A breeze caressed his face, the warmth a welcome change from the chill that had seeped into his bones throughout their ascent. Isaac couldn’t figure out how it was possible to literally feel the warmth within a memory. That he was remembering someone else’s experience in the first place was strange enough without the physical sensations it inspired. With senses so acute and responsive to the scene before him, confusion about where he actually was engulfed him. Experiencing sights and smells so real made it nearly impossible to determine if what appeared to be truth was a dream, or if he had been miraculously transported to what could only be described as Eden. As soon as he thought the name, a truth resonated in Isaac’s mind and there was no longer any doubt about where he was. Eden. The birthplace of the world. His perfect garden. Satisfaction swelled in his heart as he assessed his work. But it wasn’t his work. It was His work.</p>
<p>“Yes, son, it is my work.” The same voice that had spoken to him earlier reverberated through him again.</p>
<p>“How am I seeing this?” Isaac spoke the words in hushed reverence, “How is it I am present, here, in Your garden?”</p>
<p>“You are here because I am here. I am everywhere. I am present within all things and have always been. I am within you. I have chosen you for my purpose, so now you are where I am as well.” Isaac felt unimaginable joy pulse within him.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Father! I am undeserving of such a gift.”</p>
<p>“That’s where you are wrong. Because of my son you are perfect in my sight. He has made you deserving of this place, and of me. This is what I want for all my children. You will bring them to me and reunite my family.”</p>
<p>Isaac knew there had always been a calling on his life, but he had never imagined it to be anything so overwhelming as what had just been revealed to him. The joy so recently inhabiting him was replaced by all encompassing doubt. Who was he that he could unite God’s family? He wasn’t a great speaker like his cousin, Dylan, or a military leader like Lucas. Dinah had always been able to connect with people with ease. Isaac had spent his life in relative solitude. His circle of friends had been loyal, but few. Of all the people in his life however, he had been most closely bonded with his father. It was that loss that had affected the trajectory of his life most profoundly. His dad had commissioned him with the responsibility to live out his faith. Now that commission had taken on an entirely new meaning.</p>
<p>“What is it that you doubt?” God spoke gently, without accusation.</p>
<p>“I doubt myself. There are so many more qualified people to do what you need done.” Shame colored Isaac’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“What you are saying is you don’t trust me to know what you are capable of better than you do. Though I have known you before you were even a thought, and designed you exactly as you are, you believe I am mistaken?” The lord posed the question in a such a way that Isaac felt as though he had hurt His feelings.</p>
<p>“No! Of course not, Lord! I trust you!” Isaac was desperate to convince him that his faith was sufficient even though he knew it was not.</p>
<p>“If you trust me, then you must trust yourself. I have created you for this purpose. I will give you strength when you need to be strong. I will give you wisdom and discernment when you need guidance. The path will not be easy, but I will be with you.” Each word brought comfort and confidence.</p>
<p>The scene before Isaac changed. Graffitied concrete replaced the garden. Rubble cluttered the streets amidst the monoliths that once symbolized the greatness a, now broken, city could barely hope to achieve again. People more closely resembling wraiths huddled in alleys between the fallen spires of man’s overconfidence. Their sunken cheeks and sallow skin belied tragedy ongoing and severe. Children, covered in filth, cowered behind their parents. Worse than their physical state was the emptiness in their eyes. Abject hopelessness pierced pools of innocence.</p>
<p>Isaac’s breath caught in his throat and tears stung his eyes as he recognized, possibly for the first time, the truly unmet need his world was now faced with. It was not their hunger, or their filth that struck him. It was the fear that limited their every movement. A fear that overtook every thought and brought worry that even a base existence was impossible. There was no light at the end of their tunnel anymore. Only more darkness, yearning, and terror.</p>
<p>Faith had become such a taboo subject with the rise of relative socialist ideals that the marginalized no longer had a servant. They had vocal champions, but voice was the extent of their actions. Those who had actually been the ones to minister to the poor were bullied into silence for their belief in right and wrong. Now the desolate were used as propaganda to advance a cause.   They were no longer human. In reality, they never were to the ones who paraded them out like mascots whenever they wanted to punish the wealthy or the righteous for their very existence.</p>
<p>In that moment, Isaac began to see the world through the eyes of the father. At first the sorrow nearly broke him, but then it released a rage at the injustice he could barely control. Isaac felt fire overtake him from the inside, a billowing inferno of white heat pouring out from a broken heart in righteous anger, ready to consume the evil that had created such loss.</p>
<p>“Lord, tell me how to stop this! I can’t let this continue!”</p>
<p>“I will show you the way. Your words will be my words.”</p>
<p>“I am ready Father! Use me for your purpose!”</p>
<p>The flames in Isaac’s soul began to build around him. They enclosed him and pressed in. He could no longer see the city or its people. The fire grew hotter the closer it drew to him, until he could no longer look upon it. Isaac closed his eyes and he could hear the crackling of the flames grow louder. Everything else was blotted out and there was nothing but heat and noise. In the moment Isaac was sure he would be overcome a great rushing wind quenched the flames and left him in silence.</p>
<p>“Arise and fulfill my purpose for you!” The word of the Lord was sheer power.</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord! I am but a tool in your hand.” Isaac’s words were a whisper in comparison to the voice of God.</p>
<p>“No, you are much more than that.”</p>
<p>Isaac’s eyes flew open and he found himself lying at the edge of the cliff. Devin was crouched over him, worry etched in every line of his face.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?!” The panic in Devin’s voice undeniable.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Isaac sat up as he spoke.</p>
<p>“What happened? One minute you were fine and the next you went rigid and nearly fell over the edge. I barely caught you.”</p>
<p>“I was with God.” Isaac didn’t know what else to say so he just spoke the truth.</p>
<p>“With God? What do you mean with God?”</p>
<p>“I mean he called me to himself and I was where he was.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure it was God? You were so hot I thought you were going to spontaneously combust at one point!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure!” Isaac couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>“Well what did he tell you?”</p>
<p>Isaac smiled in awe as he recalled the word burned into his mind the moment before his eyes opened.</p>
<p>“I am going to make you the shepherd of my people.”</p>

The post <a href="/2017/02/tempest/">Tempest</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The vase shattered against the wall, ceramic shrapnel rebounding an impressive distance. Kieran took a deep breath as he surveyed the destruction before him. His penthouse, once ordered and pristine, looked as if it had been vandalized. In reality it had been the victim of a rage far more powerful than any vengeful enemy. This was not the first time he had witnessed the true meaning of the phrase “Hell hath no fury…” Kieran searched for the right words to sooth the tempest that was his partner, but finding none, decided silence was a wiser tack to take. He took solace in the fact the projectile had found the only wall in the cavernous room and not one of the enormous windows that lined the other three borders.</p>
<p>Knowing from previous experience the unpredictable nature of these tantrums, he decided to make himself comfortable on the overstuffed sofa to wait things out. Kieran thought how odd he must look as he danced his way through the chaos strewn across the floor. He had heard of tiptoeing through the tulips and nearly laughed at his own spectacle, treading carefully in an attempt to avoid the antique shards and their former floral residents. At six feet six inches tall and fifty pounds beyond the two hundred mark, he was not what anyone would call dainty. After he had eased his way down onto the sofa beneath the largest window that overlooked the Hudson, the newly minted silence became apparent. His trip through the mine field had left him the sole resident living in the crosshairs of an eerily quiet woman. Kieran was now in the eye.</p>
<p>“And what exactly do you think you’re doing?” Gretchen didn’t even pretend to hide her contempt.</p>
<p>“Waiting for you to tire yourself out.” Now that she was talking, Kieran knew he had to match strength with strength.</p>
<p>“You should be just as angry as I am! You were the one made to look a fool!” Her tone was venomous.</p>
<p>“And what good would it do for both of us to lose control? I much prefer sanity.” He never took his eyes from hers. To blink was to surrender.</p>
<p>“Sanity?! You expect me to be sane when some interloper dressed like a druid just stole our moment, and our crowd’s loyalty? He made them think!! There is nothing more dangerous to a mob than a conscience.” Acid scorched his ears with every syllable she uttered.</p>
<p>“What would you have had me do? Should I have strangled him with my bare hands? Leapt from the podium and crushed him? Showing concern would have been worse than anything he did. That would have been the weakness you fear so much.” Kieran remained implacable.</p>
<p>“Weakness? You think I fear weakness? You may not be as intelligent as I thought. I fear losing control. I am afraid of what our benefactor will do to us if we can’t control the masses. What concerns me even more is that you don’t share my fears. Why is that? Why are you not smart enough to be afraid?” Her derision was palpable.</p>
<p>“I am not afraid because death comes for us all. When and how is beyond my control, so why would I waste time being afraid? If my life is forfeit over this incident then so be it. Somehow I don’t believe that will be the case however. There is far more going on than we have been led to believe. I don’t like being a pawn, nor will I continue to be one, for anyone. I want to know what is really going on and who we are dealing with. Does that seem unreasonable to you?” Kieran posed the question as calmly as he could.</p>
<p>“If you had wanted to know what was really going on you would have asked before we got involved to start with. Changing the rules now is going to cost us far more than knowing the answers to your questions will gain us. What we need to do is find the man in the robes and execute him in the most public way possible. It is the only way to regain the momentum we had. The deadline is nearly upon us, and we don’t have nearly enough people to serve our purpose at this point.” Gretchen had regained her composure and was doing her best to appeal to Kieran’s logical side.</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re right, but I don’t intend to keep making the same mistakes I’ve already made.” Quiet resolve shown in the set of his jaw.</p>
<p>“Enough!” Gretchen screamed, “I won’t allow you to ruin everything I’ve worked for! Maybe you’re ok with going back to having and being nothing, but I’m not, and I won’t let you drag me down with you!”</p>
<p>Kieran rose from his seat and turned to face the hulking outlines of black on black that was the city skyline. He had known for some time that he was a tool of convenience for Gretchen. She would stay as long as he was useful to her, but her ambitions far outstripped his own. The idea of losing her was not one he relished, but the events of the day had given him pause. He had to look at his life and consider what he wanted it to be. The truth was that he was not satisfied with things the way they were at the moment. This was not the vision he had for this new world.</p>
<p>When the man in the hood demonstrated a power that required no violence, no intimidation, only a call to something more fundamentally human, Kieran recognized what he and Gretchen had missed in their approach. The man didn’t call for punishment. Just the opposite. He called for self-reflection, and mercy. What amazed Kieran was how quickly the bloodlust was silenced in that once ravenous mob. The connection the man was able to establish between the accusers and the accused was the key.</p>
<p>Kieran chewed on the words he needed to speak for a long moment before he faced Gretchen. In that moment, none of the beauty that had drawn him to her in the first place was visible. All he could see was the greed, the anger, and the jealousy that she had poured out all over their home. It was the confirmation he needed.</p>
<p>Just as Kieran drew a deep breath in preparation for what he knew would be as difficult a sentence as he had ever uttered, the lights in the room were extinguished. He heard Gretchen scream, a blood curdling shriek that left him both breathless, and desperate to save her from whatever horrors may have found her. Her cry was abruptly terminated, its end even more terrifying for Kieran than its beginning.</p>
<p>“Gretchen!” Kieran bellowed as he groped his way back toward the last place he knew her to be standing. This trip a far cry from his careful crossing earlier. The debris splayed across the floor proved even more treacherous in the pitch blackness than he imagined it to be in the light. The lack of response to his stricken call propelled him forward. Fortune was not with him however, and Kieran found himself half running, half crawling after the voice of a ghost. The remnants of the vase mercilessly tore at his hands and knees as he lurched through the dark. He could feel his throat constricting in panic as thoughts raced through his mind. What if he couldn’t reach her in time? What if the next thing he put his hand on was her lifeless form?</p>
<p>Before he could slip any deeper into the abyss of fear he was creating for himself, the lights exploded into brilliant existence. Kieran rolled to his back and covered his eyes in self-defense. With his eyes squeezed shut against the glare, he strained to hear any sign of Gretchen. His own breathing was all that greeted him. Kieran shifted his position so as to be able to get up while still shielding his eyes. He was not prepared for what he saw.</p>
<p>The room had been returned to its original pristine condition. Gretchen was nowhere to be found. It was as though her entire tirade had never happened. Confused and disoriented, all he could think of with any clarity was that he had not reached Gretchen in time. She was gone, who knows where, and there was nothing he could do about it. How had this happened? She needed him and he had failed her.</p>
<p>“You have not failed her. Yet.” A soft voice, full of power and intensity, brought the torrent of his thoughts to a grinding halt. Terror gripped him as recognition broke over his consciousness. Kieran spun toward where the voice had come from. What he saw left him paralyzed.</p>
<p>A man in an impeccably tailored black suit sat on the sofa beneath the window. He appeared to be completely at ease, his hands resting in his lap. When he spoke again, his colorless eyes burned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dinah whimpered in relief at the sight of Dylan and collapsed to her knees beside him. She immediately put two fingers to his left wrist and located the pulse she was desperate to find. Pulling him onto her lap, she cradled his head while she examined his features for signs of injury or abuse. Dinah was relieved to find neither.</p>
<p>“Dylan,” she called his name softly, not wanting to scare him. Her cousin didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Dylan.” Her voice was firm this time, but still Dylan didn’t stir.</p>
<p>“Dylan!” Desperation began to creep in this time and she shook him by the shoulders. Finally, a groan seeped from his inert form and she breathed a sigh of relief. His eyes fluttered open and she smiled, tears of gratitude flowing from hers.</p>
<p>“How did you find me?” His voice cracked as he tried to sit up.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. What happened to you? How did you end up here?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea. I remember being attacked from behind on the rooftop. I didn’t even get to see who jumped me before being thrown off. I must have passed out on the way down and landed on a balcony or something. There’s no way I could have lived otherwise. I woke up on the slab, but I was sure I was dead. I’m not really sure what happened next. I must have been dreaming. It wasn’t actually possible.” His voice gave way on him at the end.</p>
<p>“Nothing is impossible anymore. Trust me.” Dinah stood and offered Dylan her hand. “Can you stand?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m not hurt, just a little groggy.” He took her hand and found his feet. He also found himself in his cousin’s embrace. He patted her back and tried to reassure her. “I’m ok. I promise. I don’t know how, but I am.”</p>
<p>“You have no idea how worried I was. I just thank God you’re here, and alive.” Dinah squeezed him tighter for a moment longer and then released him, surveying the rest of him to make sure he wasn’t just playing off an injury.</p>
<p>“I gotta say, I’m pretty happy to see you too. I wasn’t sure how I was going to get back. Do you have a transport waiting?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly. You aren’t the only one with a tale to tell when it comes to ending up here.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Dylan’s confusion was plain on his face.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say that my transportation was other-worldly.” Dinah couldn’t help but laugh at her own play on words. The day’s events had been so impossible, improbable, supernatural, that her only response could be joyous wonder.</p>
<p>“We can talk about it later. Right now we need to figure out how to get back without being caught.” Dinah started to move back toward the door she had come from when Dylan cried out in shock, causing her to start violently. “What is it?!”she shrieked.</p>
<p>“Y-you,” Dylan stammered, “You&#8217;re glowing!”</p>
<p>Dinah felt foolish for not remembering that there was ethereal light emanating from her very being. She also wondered how Dylan hadn’t noticed before now. She looked down sheepishly and mumbled, “I know.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you know?” Dylan was still gaping at her.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s kind of hard to not know you’re glowing, don’t you think?” Dinah tried to make light of it.</p>
<p>“But, how?” Dylan clearly wasn’t going to let it go, not that Dinah could blame him. It had to be shocking.</p>
<p>“It’s a gift from God.” Dinah thought saying things simply would be the best way to position it.</p>
<p>“Wait! You say that like He gave it to you personally. Not like you have found out you have this gift, but like He actually gave it to you.” Dylan did not sound nearly as skeptical as Dinah expected him to be.</p>
<p>“He did. He brought me here to you.”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure He brought me here too,” Dylan hesitated, considering how best to say what he wanted to next, finally deciding to just say it, “I didn’t get to see Him clearly, but his voice. Dinah, it was your dad’s voice.”</p>
<p>“I know. That’s how he appeared to me too.” Dinah’s eyes glistened with the same emotion that thickened her voice.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t actually your dad though was it? I mean, it couldn’t have been, right?” Dylan was almost apologetic as he asked.</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t actually him, but I think God knew that would be the most comfortable and familiar way for you and I to experience Him.” Dinah stepped forward and took her cousin’s hand with an encouraging smile, “I know there is more to your story here, but before we get lost in that, we need to get back. The others need to know you’re alive.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Ok. Do you know where we are?”</p>
<p>“I was hoping you could tell me.”</p>
<p>“Well, I did get to explore some before I blacked out again. My best guess is the old public library.” Dylan hoped he was wrong. Getting back to headquarters from there would be treacherous at best, and suicide at worst.</p>
<p>“Gotcha. Well that will make this interesting. Have you seen any patrols go by?” Her tone had that forced optimism Dylan had always loved about Dinah. Even in the darkest moments, she had always been a light. He wasn’t sure she even realized she was doing it, let alone the impact it had on those around her.</p>
<p>“Interesting. Yes, it will definitely be interesting.” Dylan laughed as he spoke, unable to hide his amusement.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?” Dinah narrowed her eyes at him as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Nothing. You just always know how to make things a little easier, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Dinah shrugged, “You’re welcome, I guess.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen anything in the area, but I’m not sure how long I’ve been here, and I haven’t been conscious the whole time so there’s no telling what is going on out there with any certainty.”</p>
<p>“Then we are just going to have to be careful,” she chirped.</p>
<p>“You think?” Dylan punched Dinah in the shoulder. It was his customary response to her sarcasm.</p>
<p>They worked their way back upstairs. Dylan still was a little unnerved by Dinah’s status as a literal beacon of light. He knew, though, his own life was a far bigger miracle. A vast number of unexplainable things had happened since he ascended to the rooftop of that tower. His cousin’s luminescence was really on the tame side when it came down to it. He recognized that a deviation from his long held expectations of the world was in order. Clearly, it was not still the world he had believed it to be. It was a world infused with power he knew nothing about. Dylan was surprised that he wasn’t uncomfortable in his new reality. Apparently he was not as attached to normal as he thought he was.</p>
<p>Lost in his own thoughts, Dylan nearly ran into Dinah as they reached the top of the stairs that led to library’s foyer. He was about to step around her when she threw her arm out and pushed him back behind her. He noted with curiosity that she was no longer glowing, then he realized why.</p>
<p>An array of armed men had created a perimeter around the outer edge of the room. It was clear from their matching black uniforms and equipment that these were not rebel forces. Dylan could see the insignia of the New World government on the arm patch of the soldier standing right in front of them. His back was turned and there had been enough noise in the room to allow their approach to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Dylan rested a hand on Dinah’s shoulder as he leaned in to whisper in her ear, “There’s too many of them. We will have to find another way out.”</p>
<p>Dinah remained silent and stationary. She could feel power swelling in her chest. The immediate panic and fear that had exploded in her mind at her first sight of the soldiers had been overwhelmed by indescribable peace and confidence. Her father’s voice spoke in the back of her mind.</p>
<p>“You know you have but to ask,” he soothed.</p>
<p>“Thank you Father,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Who are you talking to? Come on! We have to go!” Dylan tugged at her arm, and still Dinah remained steadfast.</p>
<p>“Dylan, do you trust me?” Dinah searched his eyes for the answer to her question.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he replied after an extended pause.</p>
<p>“Then follow me and believe.”</p>
<p>Dinah pushed the energy she felt in her core outward, all the while praying and giving thanks for His protection. Immediately cries of confusion rang out from the men. Their hands flew to their eyes clawing at the darkness that had suddenly gripped them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Dinah took Dylan’s hand and led her bewildered cousin quietly through the chaos. More sentries poured in from other parts of the building to investigate the cause of the commotion and they too were blinded the moment they entered the foyer.</p>
<p>“How are you doing this?” Dylan gasped as he stumbled after Dinah.</p>
<p>Before Dinah could answer a searing voice burned through the cacophony, stopping them just feet from the front door.</p>
<p>“That’s far enough. I can’t have you leaving our little party before I’ve even gotten to meet the guests of honor.”</p>

The post <a href="/2016/12/awareness/">Awareness</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Devin’s throat was raw from the scream that tore through it when the gun was fired. The scene burned into his mind’s eye. It was as though time froze. From his vantage point, crouched by the fire, Devin could see every detail with a clarity that filled him with both terror and resignation. Isaac stood with his arms wide spread, as the third assailant squeezed the trigger of his AR-15. There was no possible way for him to stop Isaac’s death. He had never felt such helplessness in his entire life. All he could do was watch as his cousin was thrown backwards onto the frozen earth. His body crashed down in silent finality, an unmoving heap in the middle of the clearing.</p>
<p>The gunman looked down upon his victim in apparent detachment before turning his face toward Devin who remained rooted to the ground, completely immobilized by fear. Leaves crunched beneath the man’s feet as he paced closer, stepping over Isaac’s lifeless form. Each footfall felt like a hammer blow to Devin’s chest. The man’s presence seemed to pulse outward in blasts of energy that increased in direct proportion to his proximity. He had never wanted the ability to disappear more than he did right now however, with no place to hide, Devin could only await what he knew his fate to be. Unable to take his eyes away from Isaac, Devin sensed more than saw the intruder raise his gun to point the barrel at his chest. He tensed for the shot that would end his life, just like it had his cousin’s.</p>
<p>“So much for chosen.” A voice like a lit cigarette burned Devin’s ears. The word choice grabbed his attention and he looked up at the assassin.</p>
<p>“What do you mean chosen? Chosen by who? For what?” Devin was surprised he had been able to put voice to his thoughts. He was no coward, but he had never watched anyone executed right in front of him before either. It would appear he had become more desensitized to the violence of this new world than he had thought.</p>
<p>“Chosen by God to make straight your ways.” A voice ashed from behind a monster’s mask. The words would have staggered Devin had he not already been on his knees. His cousin acting as God’s emissary seemed a little far fetched. Recent events would be much easier to explain if it were true though. Seeing Isaac’s impact on the two other men in the clearing certainly left a void in reason. Something supernatural definitely was at work.</p>
<p>“If he is chosen by God then that would make you….” Devin’s voice trailed off as truth rolled through his mind. At that exact moment the most powerful surge of energy yet crashed over him. He could tell that the stranger was pleased by this recognition of his dark origin.</p>
<p>“Now you begin to see what’s really happening. This is my master’s world. You and everyone in this place belong to him.” There was reverence in the tone, or possibly fear.</p>
<p>“I don’t belong to anyone but me,” Devin retorted before he could stop himself, but the figure simply laughed a horrifying howl that sent chills down Devin’s spine.</p>
<p>“Then you have already given yourself over to him. Your independence is your undoing. Instead of the strength you believe it to be, it is your greatest weakness. Pride is my master’s favorite weapon against the weak-minded.”</p>
<p>Devin felt like he had been punched in the gut. Recognition of his own failing flooded his mind. Regret began to bubble like tar, ensnaring his thoughts in guilt. He looked up at the creature before him, as he now knew it was the furthest thing possible from human, and was surprised to see that it had lowered its gun. Triumph emanated from its mind. Devin knew now that the energy he felt before was really the demon’s consciousness overpowering him. It was drawing strength from his weakness, pain, and fear, but there was nothing he could do to stop those feelings in that moment.</p>
<p>“I thought you were going to kill me.” Devin stuttered the words, terrified he was asking for his own death.</p>
<p>“Then who would tell everyone their prophet is dead?” the demon’s voice burned even hotter in Devin’s mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a great rushing wind exploded in the clearing. It was unlike anything Devin had ever experienced before. All his breath was sucked from his lungs. He lay on the on the ground, gasping for air as the unreal scene unfolded. Trees were snapped liked matchsticks and thrown around like so much kindling. A blinding swirl of dead leaves and pine needles whipped through the air. Then it ceased as quickly as it commenced.</p>
<p>The fire had been instantly extinguished, yet a light almost too bright to look at was blazing from the center of the clearing. Devin had to shield his eyes with his arm, not just from the light, but from the heat. He imagined being exposed to a blast furnace felt similar. His antagonist was not faring any better than he was. The demon howled in pain as soon as the light and heat broke over them. Devin desperately searched for the source of the scorching heat but was blinded by the intensity of the light.</p>
<p>Then a voice reverberated through the clearing with such power it made the demon’s pulse of energy feel like a whisper in a hurricane. Devin flattened himself to the ground with his arms covering his head. Still, every cell in his body responded to the voice, drawn to it like it was being called home.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so fast to claim victory, demon! I am no prophet. Where you see a servant, the Master dwells. I died once, for all time. Death has no authority over me! Now be gone! Return to the pit from whence you came.” The voice grew steadily in power, which seemed impossible, even considering what Devin had already witnessed.</p>
<p>As soon as the voice was done speaking light exploded through Devin’s squeezed shut eyelids and he heard a wail filled with pain unlike anything he could have ever imagined. The smell of sulfur overwhelmed him to the point he had to roll over and wretch. Terror filled thoughts ran rampant through his stunned mind. Devin considered himself to be as level headed as they come. Demons and all powerful voices definitely didn’t fall into his realm of expertise. He wiped the sick form his lips and, with great trepidation, looked around to see where the voice had come from, unsure whether or not he actually wanted to know.</p>
<p>Before he could discern who had saved him, Devin came face to face with the smoldering pile of ash that had been his oppressor. There was no longer any doubt where the sulfurous stench had come from that made him ill. Just as Devin made the effort to get to his knees, a hand came in offering assistance. Without thinking, Devin took it and was pulled to his feet. To his utter amazement, Isaac stood before him. The trademark smirk he had inherited from his father tugging at the corner of his lips. Devin couldn&#8217;t conceal the shock on his face. The sheer impossibility of what was happening was more than he could comprehend.</p>
<p>“What? Aren&#8217;t you happy to see me?!” Isaac quipped sarcastically.</p>
<p>“But you&#8217;re dead. I watched you die.” Devin spoke with justifiable incredulity. He wanted to believe that anyone in his position would have reacted in a similar way.</p>
<p>“Death can no longer hold me.” Isaac spoke with an authority that was almost as unfathomable as his resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?! How is that possible? And how did you know what to say to those men? Where did that come from?” He could hear the demand in his questions but felt entirely unapologetic. Considering what he had just been through he felt he deserved answers.</p>
<p>Isaac clearly didn’t feel the same as he turned away from Devin and walked toward the other two men who were still in the clearing, lying on the ground.   He knelt next to the first man, Alfred, gently shook him awake and helped him to his feet.</p>
<p>“I know you don’t understand what has happened here, but you need to go to your daughter. Just know that you have been set free, and so has your daughter, Ellie. Now go, and tell no one of what you have seen here.” Isaac spoke with the same authority as Devin had heard in the voice speaking to the demon. Alfred stumbled from the clearing, going back the way they had come.</p>
<p>Isaac moved on to the second man who had already gotten to his feet. Leeroy watched warily as Isaac approached him.</p>
<p>“You have nothing to fear from me, Leeroy. In fact, I have great plans to prosper you and your family. Go to your mother and tell her that her faith has restored you to her. Faith like hers is rare. I will call on you when I need you.” As he spoke these last words, Isaac placed his hand on Leeroy’s chest and a glow emanated from beneath his palm. Leeroy gasped as though he were emerging from a prolonged stint under water. He grabbed Isaac’s shoulders to keep from falling to his knees.</p>
<p>“I am yours!” Leeroy breathed the words as he continued to try to catch his breath.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Now go and tell no one of what you have seen here.” Isaac removed his hand from Leeroy’s chest and the man ran after his companion.</p>
<p>Isaac turned back to Devin who had watched everything that passed between his cousin and the two men with wonder and amazement.</p>
<p>Devin fell to his knees. He could see his cousin standing before him, but he was so much more than the man who he had climbed the mountain with that morning. The man had been transfigured.</p>
<p>“Can you see me now?” Isaac spread his arms, “Do you recognize me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord! I can see you!”</p>

The post <a href="/2016/11/obsidian/">Obsidian</a> first appeared on <a href="">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two powerful spotlights blasted their beams straight up into the obsidian sky, piercing the otherwise uninterrupted shroud draped over deserted monoliths, and silent thoroughfares of the once great city. At their base, a seething horde gathered to honor its mortal deity. Odes to tumult and chaos, howled toward the moon by a sea of degenerates, befouled one of Fall’s last pleasant evenings. Winter’s scouring wind would soon blast the faithful and faithless alike, indiscriminate in its harsh discourse. All would seek shelter from its bitterness. But tonight, all manner of demon joined the congregation worshipping at the altar of the beast.</p>
<p>The madness of a crowd was something that Gretchen never gave any credence to prior to the fall. She had believed in mankind’s humanity. Its ability to choose the right path, at an individual level, in spite of peer pressure. It wasn’t until she witnessed the mob first hand during the revolution that she was willing to concede how different people can become, when faced with standing their ground, while their beliefs come under attack. She had watched as men and women devolved into animals over something as simple as who was in line for the bathroom first. In reality, evolution, or its undoing, had nothing to do with it. An innate brokenness did.</p>
<p>Gretchen recognized there was a darkness present in every single person.   Self-preservation combined with entitlement served as a catalyst for the most inhuman of outlooks. The possibility of baseness presenting itself, real, in nearly any situation where enough pressure was brought to bare. In the back of her mind, she heard a voice telling her how to use the madness. It was a cold voice. The voice of ambition, self-importance, and an indifference toward anything that didn’t advance those purposes. Initially she brushed it aside. Giving in to such ideals was something that would make her no better than those that had devolved around her. “Not so,” said the cruel voice, “It would allow you to sway the lesser creatures of this world toward a greater calling.” That was the moment she realized how easy it would be to use that depravity. Control could be exerted over the masses simply by planting the right idea in the minds of a few. They would do the rest. They would convince their friends, their neighbors, anyone who would listen, based entirely on emotion. Even reasonable people would succumb to the will of the mob eventually. The mob would be an instrument of her will.</p>
<p>Proof of her assertions played out right before her eyes as Kieran stood on the steps of a forgotten memorial, where towers once reached toward the heavens. Throngs of people hung on his every word. He wasn&#8217;t telling them anything prophetic or world altering. He simply told them what they wanted to hear. He did it with passion and fervor. His words like bellows stoking a furnace to a white hot blaze.   They would burn the world to ash at the whim of a madman.</p>
<p>Despite the ravenous maw of the crowd, Gretchen felt perfectly safe. She was confident in the plan she had devised and everything to this point had given her reason to remain confident. She, through Kieran, had been able to channel the masses into a weapon more violent, and more effective than anything seen since the French Revolution. She gave them someone to blame, and the means by which to exact revenge for perceived offenses. As long as she kept them sated, they were loyal, and it was easy to feed them someone new when they became restless.</p>
<p>Desperation was a constant Gretchen and Kieran counted on. It was the single most powerful tool in their arsenal. It was plentiful as well. People who believed their lives would be bettered through the revolution were still as dissatisfied with their circumstances as they had been prior to the fall. The powerful had fled to Western Europe, taking their money and their businesses with them. Politicians paid a terrible price, but the ones who really ran the country escaped with ease when they saw things going south, leaving a void that was not easily filled. Small businesses were destroyed in the rioting and looting, leaving few who were able, or willing, to drag commerce forward.</p>
<p>Everything that could be consumed was, without thought to what would happen when it was gone. The concept of finite resources was simply beyond comprehension for the throng. Gretchen and Kieran knew that even a semblance of critical thinking could leave them in a worse position than they were in when they started. Yet, they also knew that the likelihood of reasonable arguments prevailing was less than a realistic possibility. People were too insecure to believe their own thoughts. They wanted to be told how to feel and what to do. It was simpler for them that way. It also meant someone else was ultimately responsible for their behavior. They could blame the world at all times. It didn’t matter that they would eventually run out of patsies, but they hadn’t yet.</p>
<p>Kieran was nearly done whipping the crowd into a frenzy. He looked toward Gretchen and she nodded. He pointed toward two men standing beside a large rectangular object draped with a black curtain. The men stripped the cloth away to reveal a stainless steel cage, reflecting the light from the torches and lanterns held by the crowd.</p>
<p>A wretch of a man huddled on the floor of the cage, covered in filth. He wore a grey, pinstriped suit and leather dress shoes. His jacket was torn at the shoulder seems, while his shirt displayed dark splotches of, what had to be, blood. Stubble shadowed his cheeks, chin, and neck. His bound hands were raised to shield his eyes from the light. They shook violently as they hid his face, his fear evident.</p>
<p>The crowd erupted into jeers and catcalls. Their lust for blood clearly on display. The man cowered in response to the noise, and begged for mercy. This only enraged the spectators further leading to increased volumes and violent overtures. Gretchen couldn’t hide her pleasure at the corporate aggression. It was exactly what she wanted, and expected, to happen. Kieran had such a talent when it came to stirring emotions in others. It was as though he could read their collective mind and strike the perfect chord that would resonate within their subconscious.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we bring our guest into the light?” Kieran again motioned to his men and they moved to unlock the door. With some difficulty, they dragged the resistant man out of his confines and propped him up beside the podium as if he were some kind of mannequin on display.</p>
<p>“How the mighty have fallen! This man was once part of the ruling class. One of them. He cared nothing for any of you then and cares even less now. He can think of nothing but saving himself as he stands here before you. What say you? Should we grant him mercy?” Kieran raised a thumb out in front of him.</p>
<p>The scene resembled something out of the Roman Empire. A coliseum full of zealots screaming for brutality as their entertainment. The call for vengeance was so blind that nobody cared to know who the man was or what his actual crimes were. It didn’t matter that he wasn’t actually any different than any of them, That he had been stolen from his hovel in an alley, and dressed in the suit just for this purpose, wasn’t something the masses wanted to know. They claimed the man’s life without questioning who he was for even a moment. If Kieran said he was an enemy then he was an enemy.</p>
<p>Gretchen smiled at the vociferous demands of the faithful, gratified by how easy it was to manipulate the rabble of society. She had never considered herself superior to anyone prior to the dissolution of the civilized world. Now she knew she was. She turned her attention back to Kieran and nodded at him again, a cold smile fixed on her otherwise lovely features. Just like that she condemned the man in the suit to death.</p>
<p>Kieran put the choice to the crowd once more and acclamation roared with one voice. The man was forced to his knees on the cold stone steps. Tears streamed down his face in a silent plea from a man resigned to his fate in every other way. His eyes closed as the barrel of a gun pressed into the back of his head.</p>
<p>It was in that moment that a lone dissenter stepped forward from the crowd and raised his hands for quiet. Silence fell as the figure, dressed in an obsidian black robe with a hood that hid his face, climbed the steps toward the condemned man. Kieran Skarsgard stood frozen at the podium, astonished. The executioner turned his gun on the newcomer, but a simple wave of the hand from the hooded figure drove the assassin to his knees. Strong hands pulled the unfortunate man in the tattered suit to his feet. The man in the suit grasped his savior by the shoulders as gratitude poured from his lips. The man in the cloak leaned in close and whispered in the other man’s ear. A visible change came over the man in the suit. He straightened up, squared his shoulders, and walked down the steps toward the mob.</p>
<p>“Grab him! Don’t let him get away,” Gretchen screamed.</p>
<p>Then the man in the cloak turned on the crowd and pointed a finger at them. When he spoke, his voice resonated with such intensity and authority that he would not be denied.</p>
<p>“Let him without sin cast the first stone.”</p>
<p>And the crowd parted silently to let the man in the suit pass.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dinah pressed her forehead to the floor. The Voice of God reverberated throughout the entirety of her being. She felt as though He was everywhere, but she dared not look upon Him. The blaze before her was too bright to take in, even had she wanted to. Her senses were completely overwhelmed, to the point that they were so acutely sensitive they may as well not have worked at all. Dinah wasn’t sure what emotion she was feeling anymore either. It could have been fear, but it was so profoundly different than the state she normally lived in that it seemed more likely to be joy. It wasn’t a sensation she was familiar with. A sense of calm, and peace, and power emanated from the flame. Dinah struggled to wrap her mind around the possibility that this was actually happening. Disbelief would have been an expected reaction, except that it was belief that formed the basis of everything that was occurring. Yet somehow she still had trouble believing God would reveal himself to her. Who was she to come face to face with the Great I Am?</p>
<p>“Did you not call upon me child?” The voice was like a multitude in one. It sounded like the entire world was speaking to her at once. “I need your help, Lord. Desperately! Forgive my unbelief, but I never expected to hear your voice.” Dinah couldn’t control the tremors that shook her from head to toe.</p>
<p>“I don’t measure your faith as a man would. I have heard the prayers you couldn’t speak, and know your heart.” God’s voice soothed her fear.</p>
<p>“Thank you Lord! I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to say anything. The Holy Spirit has called out to me on your behalf. I know that it is your cousin that you worry for. Your worry is needless.” God’s authority was absolute and evident in every syllable, yet Dinah still wanted reassurance.</p>
<p>“Lord, what do you mean? Nobody has seen Dylan. We have no idea where to find him or how to help him. How can you tell me not to worry?!” Dinah regretted her angry outburst the moment the words left her lips.</p>
<p>“You needn’t worry because I know where to find him, and how to help him, and have already done both. Trust in me and you needn’t worry ever again.” His words were not harsh but they revealed where the lack of an intentional relationship between them had left Dinah with an insecurity that could be steadied in no other way.</p>
<p>“I want to trust you. But I don’t even trust me.” Dinah whispered these last words, shame burning her cheeks.</p>
<p>“I trust you.” The Lord spoke a wholeness into Dinah with three simple words, “Now, let me show you what you cannot see.” The blaze in the center of the room was extinguished. Blackness overtook the room and Dinah covered her head, not knowing what was to come next.</p>
<p>“Still you cower. I will give you reason, not just to trust me, but to glorify my name.” The Lord’s voice grew in intensity with every word spoken, until it blinded Dinah and drowned out her consciousness. It was as though she dissolved into nothing and became everything all at once.</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes again she found herself in the middle of a marbled foyer. Sunlight streamed through high windows. The effect of dusky hues on the surrounding marble was an ethereal glow that left Dinah wondering if she was actually in heaven. As she took in her surroundings a robed figure appeared at her side. Despite his instantaneous approach, Dinah felt no fear. She could see everything as it was meant to be seen, and could immediately discern everything about her surroundings, including the robed figure’s intentions. Omniscience blossomed in her mind. It was overwhelming. Dinah gripped the sides of her head unsure her mind was built to comprehend so much at once. “This is how you were created to be. You will grow accustomed to it.” The robed figure communicated directly with her by thought. The sound that reverberated through her thoughts was richer than any voice she had ever heard. It’s beauty left her gasping for breath. “I don’t know if I can control this. It’s too much.” Dinah reached out with her mind toward the being. Toward God. She recognized from the vastness of the being’s consciousness that it could be none other than the creator. The impulse to look upon the face of God grabbed her and she turned toward Him. Knowing what she wanted, he slowly lowered his hood.</p>
<p>Dinah faltered as she stepped back, her hands clasped over her mouth. Shock reverberated through her soul. Tears of joy escaped her wide eyes and she shivered violently. God reached out and caught her with her father’s hands. It was her father’s face she saw. “Who were you expecting?” The familiar smirk she had grown up with tugged at the lips of the Almighty.</p>
<p>“Daddy?!” Dinah wasn’t sure if she spoke the word or simply thought it.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sweets.” The term of endearment washed over her.</p>
<p>“You’re God?!” Bewilderment colored her tone.</p>
<p>“Why would I not be? Does He not dwell within the hearts of all his disciples? Are we not all made in His image?</p>
<p>” The questions rang of truth that she had never really considered. She examined the curves of his face, the krinkles around his eyes, and could find nothing but her father. Even the familiar smell of his soap and aftershave filled her nostrils. Dinah threw her arms around his neck and buried her face in his chest. She had never felt such relief, or comfort, as she did in her father’s arms in that moment.</p>
<p>“Now, let me show you what you seek.” Her father, God, showed her an image of Dylan, kneeling next to a cross-shaped platform in the middle of a pitch black room.</p>
<p>Understanding exploded in Dinah’s mind. Immediately she made her way down a marble staircase toward a basement room she knew would be there. There was no way to explain how she knew, she just did. The further down she went the darker it became, until she was unable to see where to place her foot next. She knew all she needed to do was think light into existence and it would be so. In that moment, light flooded the stairwell. Shadow disappeared from in front of her and every detail was thrown into sharp relief. Dinah was astounded by the power flowing through her. She knew it was God, not her, making this possible.</p>
<p>“This is what it looks like when you trust me.” Her father stood right beside her, his whisper echoed down the corridor.</p>
<p>“Yes, Daddy,” was her response.</p>
<p>Dinah searched for the source of the light and was astonished by what she found. She saw the light shift with her movements and realized that the light was emanating from within her.</p>
<p>“Be like a light on a hill,” her father intoned, “You have taken the bowl off of your lamp stand.”</p>
<p>Dinah rushed down the rest of the steps and into a broad corridor. Her hands found rough concrete as she used the wall to keep her balance while she ran toward a door at the end of the hall. Its gold hardware glinted in her light. The rich mahogany seemed to soak up any not reflected. She fumbled with the handle, impatient to get it open. The door finally succumbed to her flailing and Dinah nearly fell into the room. It looked just like the vision she had been given upstairs. The cross-shaped dais stood at the far end of the room, bathed in the glow of her spirit. Tentative steps carried her forward, her breathing shallow as she drew closer to where she should find her cousin, if the rest of the vision she was shown held true.</p>
<p>Dinah walked around toward the head of the cross, her eyes drawn to the shadowy outline scorched into the stone. Images burst into her mind as she felt the sting of a whip across her back. When she spun around there was nobody there assaulting her. Turning back to the cross, she clasped a hand to her mouth as she realized what she was looking at. Her father appeared in that moment to wrap his arm around her waist and keep her from collapsing.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Sweets. It’s finished.” The warmth in His tone dispersed the searing pain across her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry! I don’t know how you could have taken this for me.” Her voice was a choked sob.</p>
<p>“How could I not? I love you.” His voice was soft as a breeze but strong as a hurricane all at once.</p>
<p>“I can see that now.” Dinah clung to her father for support and he smiled. “I know you can. Now your cousin needs you.” He turned her and Dylan lay on the floor at her feet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isaac stared down the gunman, his veins ablaze with adrenaline. He refused to acknowledge the weapon pointed at his chest. No matter how afraid he maybe, he wouldn&#8217;t allow the gunmen the satisfaction of knowing they had any effect on him at all. It was the only way to maintain the upper hand.</p>
<p>“What is it you want from me, exactly?” Isaac’s voice was far more steady than he had expected it to be.</p>
<p>“You can come with us. Our boss wants to speak with you.” The behemoth in the middle spoke like he was grinding granite between his teeth.</p>
<p>“I probably would have considered your request had you made it at the bottom of the mountain. Might help if I had any idea who your boss was. Since I don’t, and you didn’t do me the courtesy of making it convenient for me to say yes, I am inclined to tell you to take a hike.” It was the smug look on his assailant&#8217;s face that provided him with the resolve to stand his ground.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s unfortunate. It wasn’t really a request.” The gravel in the man’s voice made Isaac’s skin crawl.</p>
<p>“Since I don’t take orders I guess we have a problem.” Isaac worked to put as much steel into his tone as he could, then turned his back on the men and moved toward Devin and the fire.</p>
<p>Isaac was certain that resistance was not something the three masked intruders expected. Clearly, they were used to obedience, unquestioned, and immediate. The fact they hadn&#8217;t taken Devin&#8217;s comment seriously would be their undoing. Overconfidence had led to the demise of greater men than these. Isaac knew he had their attention and if they were focused on him then they would not be prepared for whatever Devin had in store for them. He would keep them talking as long as he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is your boss, and why can&#8217;t he speak for himself? Surely he would be better equipped than the three of you to relay whatever message he has for me.&#8221; Isaac let derision saturate every syllable.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to find out how well equipped we are. No one who could speak to our skills is still able to speak,&#8221; the smaller, bearded man on the left sneered. His accent was definitely not native. Isaac guessed him to be from the Deep South, possibly Alabama or Georgia, based on the genteel drawl burning with mock civility.</p>
<p>Isaac grinned at them, trying to unsettle them with his flippant attitude, and doing his best to learn as much as he could in the brief moments he had to observe them. The bearded man had a tattoo on the inside of his right forearm. It was barely visible below the cuff of his coat sleeve. Isaac wasn&#8217;t certain what it was, but it appeared to come to a point like a blade of some sort. The man was not nearly as imposing as his friend. He appeared lithe and his posture indicated a level of comfort in his own skin that was almost unsettling. Definitely a predator capable of violence.</p>
<p>The third man deprived Isaac of any clues as to his identity. His stature was somewhere between his counterparts. There was no question about his strength, with broad shoulders and thick chest stretching the confines of his camouflage coat. He was completely covered from head to toe. A skull cap, sunglasses, and muffler concealed his head and face. Gloves hid his hands and were tucked into his sleeves. He had not spoken, nor had he moved since settling in the clearing. It was his stillness that was most disquieting for Isaac. It indicated complete self-control, and that was truly terrifying. Isaac could only hope that whatever Devin had planned would give them a chance to escape.</p>
<p>Devin used the time and distraction to accumulate as many weapons as he could without drawing attention to himself. If everything worked out as planned he and Isaac would only have a few moments to take out their attackers without fear of return fire. The bacon continued to sizzle and pop in the skillet. He was grateful for the kind wind that wafted the aroma into the woods. Devin was counting on the idea that the mountain ghost who had crossed their path earlier, was ready to eat again. It had been following them nearly as long as the ghouls now entranced by Isaac&#8217;s song and dance. When it smelled the bacon, Devin was sure the big cat would come to investigate. That&#8217;s when he and Isaac would be able to make their move. The odds would even out and give them a chance. That was the best he could hope for at this point. He had made due with worse odds in the past. The .45 tucked into the back of his jeans was a comfort, but he would have to draw quickly and aim well. There was no question the men were wearing body armor, leaving extremely limited areas of opportunity when it came to putting them down. Devin harbored no misconceptions about the fact the men would need to be put down if he and Isaac were to survive.</p>
<p>As Isaac continued to engage the gunmen he heard a voice in the back of his mind. &#8220;Grace softens hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nearly lost his balance at its sound. It was his father&#8217;s voice. There was no question. An immediate sense of calm and peace enveloped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you the words. Trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaac made his way back toward the fire. He wanted more time to decide what to do next. He also needed to keep Devin from acting before he could finalize a plan and communicate it to him.</p>
<p>Isaac stepped in front of the fire and toward the Goliath of a man in the center. All three of the men visibly tensed at his approach. He spread his arms to show that he meant no harm.</p>
<p>“I’m actually glad you’re here.” The words had escaped his lips before he knew what he was saying. He could feel an intensity pressing against his mind and swelling in his chest. It was overwhelming, and submitting to the calling was the only option that seemed like it would satisfy the force drawing him in. Isaac took a deep breath and gave up control. When he spoke again, it wasn’t his voice, but his father’s that flowed from his lips.</p>
<p>“Alfred, your daughter is going to need you. When her eyes open you will want to be there.” Isaac looked the giant in the middle full in the face as he spoke. He had no idea how he knew what he did, but the change affected on the man was remarkable.</p>
<p>“What did you just say?” The rumble had turned to a whisper. “What did you just say to me?”</p>
<p>“Ellie is going to need her father when she wakes up. She will need the man you used to be. The man you still are in your heart.”</p>
<p>“How do you know about my daughter? Nobody knows I even have a daughter.”</p>
<p>“Your love for her speaks. I can hear your heart, Alfred. I know that you would do anything for her. What you need to do right now is go. She will be awake by the time you reach her. Don’t let her wait long.”</p>
<p>“Ellie hasn’t opened her eyes in a year.”</p>
<p>“I have healed her. Now go!” With these words, Isaac stretched out his hand with his palm toward Alfred, and Alfred staggered backward and gasped as though he had been struck, his eyes glazed over.</p>
<p>“I can see her,” he sobbed, “How are you doing this?!”</p>
<p>“All things are possible through Christ, who gives me strength.”</p>
<p>“But I haven’t believed in a long time.”</p>
<p>“You planted your mustard seed, and He is always faithful, even when we aren’t.”</p>
<p>Alfred’s companions were clearly becoming agitated by his behavior. They edged toward him, keeping their guns trained on Isaac all the while.</p>
<p>“Stop this!” the smaller man snarled. “Release him!”</p>
<p>“Come Leeroy, I tell you truly, your anger only serves to do you harm.” Isaac spoke with an ancient authority. “Leave that life. Return to me.”</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are?” Leeroy sneered at him. “I’ve never belonged to you.”</p>
<p>Isaac raised his other hand to Leeroy and the man fell to his knees.</p>
<p>“I have known you all the days of your life. In your darkest hours of grief and loss, whenever you called upon me, I have been there to comfort you. You have felt my presence. Even though you deny me now, I hear the prayers of your mother and stand here with you, calling you home.”</p>
<p>As sobs racked Leeroy’s body, visions only he could see shattering the barriers of his heart, Isaac turned his gaze to the third gunman. The man had watched Leeroy succumb to Isaac’s words, seemingly impassive. Without a word, he calmly took aim at Isaac and squeezed the trigger of his weapon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The knot had to be perfect. It wasn’t about anyone else’s opinion, only his own. Nobody else would have noticed or cared, he knew that. Still, he was compelled to re-tie the double windsor for a fifth time, in spite of what it did to his blood pressure. It had always been this way for him. Countless repetition in pursuit of perfection. A thousand lives lived at once, or maybe a thousand examples of existence would be more accurate. He recognized that living wasn’t nearly so anchored to circumstance.</p>
<p>Another imperfect attempt and the tie was ripped from his neck with a roar of rage that would have scattered enemies and devotees alike had there been any of either present to witness it. Taut, white skin stretched around his knuckles, evidence of his frustration, as he leaned against the desk in the center of his office. A sharp intake of breath accompanied the vexing stare he gave the wadded piece of silk crumpled on the windowsill. Anger blinded him to the beauty that expanded beyond the other side of the glass. It was a view that many had paid a premium for prior to the fall. Millions more had unwittingly sacrificed their own freedom to give it to the man who occupied it now.</p>
<p>The office door opened and a blonde woman in her early twenties walked confidently into the massive penthouse.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Why aren’t you ready?” her tone was clipped.<br />
“Just give me a minute. I still have to tie my tie.” His tone was barely controlled.<br />
“And how many times have you tied it already?” the woman stalked toward the desk.<br />
“I don’t know, but it isn’t perfect.” He seethed.</p>
<p>The derision in the woman’s tone was something the man was definitely not willing to accept from anyone else. That she had no fear of him was what drew him to her in the beginning. He loved that she was beautiful. He loved that she was brilliant. What he loved most of all though, was her ambition. She drove him. Remaining stagnant was not an option in her presence. She was the only person Keiran Skarsgard respected enough to be afraid of.</p>
<p>She sighed heavily as she searched for the tie, finally seeing it hanging tragically from the window sill. Her stilettos deflated his ego a bit more with each step as she went over to retrieve it. He felt like her disappointment was spoken in morse code through the cadence. The accessory was snatched from its perch and straightened mercilessly until it was devoid of wrinkles. After a quick inspection to verify its viability, Gretchen whipped it over Keiran&#8217;s head and pulled him close to her. Her hands moved deftly, the only sound in the room coming from the friction of silk on silk as she pulled the tie through its configurations.</p>
<p>The tie relinquished its obstinance under her touch, knotted perfectly, and hid beneath his crisp collar. Gretchen helped Keiran into his jacket. She ran her hands over his shoulders and down his chest as she leaned in to him, her lips pressed close to his ear.</p>
<p>“You are the most powerful man in the new world. All this insecurity really isn’t becoming. It doesn’t matter what your tie looks like. Nobody would be foolish enough to laugh anyway. You’re like the emperor with the new clothes. You could be stark naked and no one would dare to even question what you were doing. Besides, if they did, they’d be answering to me.” With that she pulled him close by his lapels and pressed her lips to his. She could feel his tension melt.</p>
<p>&#8220;But their fear isn&#8217;t what I want,&#8221; he whispered against her lips.</p>
<p>She pulled back from him, her eyes piercing his. &#8220;Of course it is. Fear equals compliance. When they stop fearing you that&#8217;s when you have to worry about what tie you&#8217;re wearing. That&#8217;s when you have to begin convincing them you&#8217;re right. Right now they are convinced that your way is the only choice they have. Don&#8217;t let them forget that.&#8221; Her words were icy but her tone was silken.</p>
<p>Keiran was reminded of exactly why he didn&#8217;t argue with Gretchen. There was a ruthlessness about her that was simply astounding in one so young and beautiful. To look at her anyone would think she had plenty of reason to be magnanimous toward the world, considering how generous life had been to her. Yet, her appetites were insatiable, especially when it came to acquiring and displaying power. Kieran knew very little of her past, and was wise enough not to ask. Occasionally, when the wine flowed freely at dinner, she would let details slip out from behind her carefully crafted facade of perfection. He could sense a darkness there that intrigued him. He had yet to discover its source. In truth, he wasn’t certain he wanted to know. Anything that could produce such resolve must have been truly devastating.</p>

Though, to call it a revolution may have been generous. Revolution typically denoted a unification of people against a tyrannical enemy. In this case it was more a denial of reality. An entire generation refused to accept the fact that they really were not as special as they believed themselves to be. The deserted platform had seemed like a good place to find a respite from the insanity. Kieran wasn’t expecting to find anyone else in the marbled darkness. Nor was he expecting to kill to protect them. And yet, when a gang of looters and rioters invaded the solitude and threatened worse than death, Kieran didn’t hesitate to rip the threat to shreds with his bare hands. He had often wondered since then if he was really her savior, or simply her favorite weapon. Either way, he was willing to play the part.</p>
<p>“As you wish, my dear. I will give them the tyrant in a suit that haunts their waking dreams.” Kieran’s words were equally as cold as hers had been. Every ounce of self-doubt replaced by a determination to be everything she dreamed he could be. More than a determination. A longing for approval and acceptance that drove all aspects of his behavior. He knew he had found in her the fulfillment he had searched his entire life for. As long as he fulfilled her vision for their future, she would feed his need with the affirmations everyone else in his life had denied him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man I love,&#8221; once again her tone shifted from iron to honey, &#8220;Shall I walk down with you? Or would you prefer a few moments of solitude to compose yourself?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I would enjoy your company. And everyone else will enjoy getting a look at the beauty who tempers the beast.&#8221; A smile played at the corner of his mouth as he enjoyed his own joke.<br />
&#8220;Very well then. Let me collect my purse and we can leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kieran followed her to the door where she retrieved the small clutch he hadn&#8217;t even noticed her bring in. He proffered his arm and shivered at her touch as she wrapped her arm through his. Once again he reflected on the sway she held over him. In reality, she was as much beast as he was. Her monstrosity was simply more understated. He looked as one would expect the villain to. She projected innocence, and that’s why she was so much more powerful than he was. Nobody saw her coming until it was too late.</p>
<p>Gretchen liked it that way. She was content to work behind the scenes, in the shadows. It allowed her to be ruthless without ever having to be the instrument of violence, or terror, herself. Who would believe any of this was her idea? She was one who saw past the monstrous exterior of the king. The one who curbed his rage. The only person that could love him. In truth, she stoked the fire of his rage, wielded him like a weapon, and slept soundly every night despite her transgressions. If the world only knew.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scent of history clung to the air. A fragrance of musty pages, oiled mahogany, and weathered stone. Murals adorned ceilings high above the marble floors. Brilliant sunlight flooded through the massive arched windows that faced Fifth Avenue, and bathed the grand room in dancing motes of dust. The infusion of light made Dylan squint. His time in the dimly lit basement left him unaccustomed to the sun’s glare, yet he welcomed it. He had awoken in solitude and smothering darkness. The single candle that had burned beside the slab he laid upon the night before was nothing but a wick. An infinitesimal sliver of light crawled in beneath a door on the opposite end of the massive room, and Dylan groped his way toward it on his hands and knees. The stairs outside the door had led him to a foyer with two more sets of stairs racing from opposite ends to the same plateau. After declaring the contestant to his right the winner, his exploration eventually brought him to what was once the primary study of the New York Public Library. Row after row of desks adorned with brass lamps and green lamp shades were blanketed in dust. The place had clearly been abandoned after the fall.</p>
<p>It seemed strange to Dylan that he could find no evidence of his rescuer ever having been there with him. The floors were slick with their own three-inch carpet of dust. Not a single footprint was present that he had not created himself. Nothing laid about that would indicate refugees, or squatters, using the building for a base of operation, or hiding place. In fact, everything Dylan observed told a tale of desertion and emptiness. He couldn’t reconcile what logic dictated with his own memories of the evening before. It could not possibly have been a dream. He knew he had been attacked atop the Freedom Tower. He also knew he had been thrown from its heights and should be dead. That he wasn’t was evidence of intercession by something inexplicable.</p>
<p>Dylan made his way to one of the study stations nearest the windows. A thrill of fear coursed through him as he climbed atop the desk. The trauma of falling to his death was too recent a memory to be ignored, even at a height of three feet. A deep breath steadied him as he stood to his full height. Dylan assessed the situation outside to determine his chances of reaching the Empire State Building unnoticed. He was familiar with the schedule of patrols that ran through the area, but he didn’t know what time it was. Waiting for the next patrol to roll by felt like a plan that he would rank right up there with waterboarding, or enduring his brother’s cooking. The difficulty with being in the middle of a city of skyscrapers was not being able to get a good read on the sun’s position. Dylan had no shot of determining the time with any accuracy. The way his luck was going, he would walk out the door and be picked up by a patrol the moment his feet hit the pavement.</p>
<p>He climbed down from his perch, no more knowledgable than when he ascended. The impulse to simply make a break for it was nearly overwhelming. Dylan liked to think he had many redeeming qualities, the greatest of which was his humility, yet patience was definitely not one of them. Logic dictated his best chance to make it back to base without being seen or, more importantly, caught, was to wait for nightfall.   Trying to convince his battle tuned senses of that was nearly impossible. Still, Dylan knew it was the right move.</p>
<p>With the decision made to spend the day bunkered up in his marble fortress, Dylan turned his attention to scavenging for possible resources. Considering the building covered two full city blocks, it was unlikely everything had been pillaged. From what he could see in his brief trek upstairs, it appeared that most of the books that had lined the shelves had been destroyed simply for destruction’s sake. Tattered pages and broken spines littered the floor between stacks. The irreverent were true to their moniker, showing no respect for the centuries of work, beauty, and knowledge so many others had poured their souls into.</p>
<p>Dylan had never understood how anyone could simply seek chaos based on its own merit. It was what had confused him most about society&#8217;s fall. Those rebelling against the establishment had no alternative plan to present. They just wanted the world to feel their anger. Part of him could identify with their frustration. The rage they stoked into full blown revolt, however, was not something Dylan could support. He had believed in the system, in spite of its obvious flaws. What he saw in individuals was masked and disfigured by the masses. Reasonable people were convinced to do unreasonable things by the emotional rhetoric of a few zealots.</p>
<p>After wrapping the desecrated innards of the library&#8217;s former inhabitants around a broken chair leg to form a torch, Dylan headed for the bowels of the marble behemoth. He knew he had not been alone. Exploring where he knew his rescuer to have been seemed the most logical starting point to satisfy his curiosity and identify possible scavenging opportunities.</p>
<p>Under the relief of flickering light, the room seemed even more intimidating than it had in pitch blackness. Shadows cast an eerie presence and feeling over the expanse of space. Dylan trembled as he recalled the memory of his healing the night before. Never before had he experienced the kind of power that surged through him in that moment. It was what he imagined being struck by lightening to feel like. Fire scorched through his veins, smelting away the broken slag, leaving him perfected and whole. That was something he never thought he would ever be. Whole.</p>
<p>Taking great care, Dylan inched his way forward into the room. Common sense told him there was nothing to fear, but fear rarely makes sense. So its presence remained as a brick in his gut and ash in his mouth. With the torch held aloft, and the light from the open door behind him, his silhouette stretched out to blend in with the shadow beyond his small circle of luminescence. With each step, isolation crept deeper into his chest. Nothing seemed real down here. It was all an illusion. A trick his mind had played on him. It had to be. Except it couldn’t be.</p>
<p>A large stone slab loomed up in front of Dylan. It had not been this large in his memory. Nor did he recall the cross piece, though he was in no state at the time to have perfect recall by any means. Where the cross piece met the vertical pillar there appeared to be some sort of discoloration. Upon closer inspection, the perfect outline of a man was scorched into the stone. Incredulity masked Dylan’s typically jovial features as he gazed upon the spot where he was certain he had been healed the night before. Trembling fingers reached out to verify what his eyes presented him. It was his outline.</p>
<p>Warmth spread out from his core, leaving his extremities tingling. Knees weakened from shock and adrenaline made moving any closer nearly impossible. Dylan had to will his legs to keep him upright. He traced the outline with his fingers but no soot clung to them. The stone was permanently etched. As he leaned in and brought the torch closer a secondary form was visible. It appeared that another person had lain there as well.</p>
<p>At first, Dylan thought it was a child&#8217;s body. It was smaller and almost entirely contained within his larger outline, like a shadow within a shadow. The torchlight wavered, making it difficult to discern details. Curiosity overwhelmed trepidation and a closer look was required. Since he stood near the foot of the slab, Dylan decided to start there in his evaluation.</p>
<p>The figure didn&#8217;t stretch the full length of his own body. It took only a moment for him to realize this wasn&#8217;t a child as he had originally hypothesized. He could make out bare feet crossed atop one another. Marks striped the torso. Dylan&#8217;s throat constricted. His eyes ventured further up the body. Right were the cross piece of the slab intersected. In the middle of the outline of his own chest. The arms of the shadow outline stretched out wide. Each palm marred by a darker round mark. A nail. A head adorned with a crown of thorns easily discernible above the shoulders of the outstretched arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Dear Lord!&#8221; Dylan exclaimed as his knees hit the floor beside the slab and his torch was extinguished.</p>
<p>Panic filled his chest as the darkness swallowed him. His mind raced as he found himself back where he started, in the smothering solitude. Just as that thought enveloped him, he heard it. The voice that would forever be burned into his memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear not! I am always with you.&#8221;</p>
