										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I sit down to share my Sehgahunda experience, I must first confess that I am really not your typical life-long runner.   I did not even start running or even own a pair of running shoes until 7 years ago.  I would classify myself as a recreational jogger.   In that time, I’ve run a handful of 10k’s and 5k’s, but never anything longer….and never wanted to run anything longer.  <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>I first heard about the Sehgahunda a few years ago.  The Sehgahunda (Say-ga-hunda) is a 26.3 mile trail marathon alongside the Genesee River Gorge, traversing technical single track, crossing over 100 gullies, and climbing nearly 4000 ft.  Having spent countless hours exploring Letchworth Park and being an avid hiker, the idea of a trail race there was intriguing.   In the past I&#8217;ve been tempted to find some friends to do it as a relay but had never actually pulled together a team to tackle it.   Running the whole race never even remotely crossed my mind.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>This past December a couple friends started talking about signing up for the Sehgahunda.   They joked with me about signing up with them, and I was pretty adamant that unless it was a relay, not to count on me.   As they got more serious about it, so did their pressure, but I held my ground.   I had a running routine.  At that time, my buddy Adam and I were running about 6 miles a week, year-round, in snow, wind, and mud.   I was good with that.  <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>On December 5<span data-fontsize="11">th</span>, 2017, I succumbed to pressure and registered for the Sehgahunda, my first trail marathon and my first marathon.  The good news for me was that Adam was willing to do it too, so I would not have to train alone.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>We decided we’d officially start training after the new year.   I scoured the interwebs for training plans that would take a 6 mile runner to a 26 point 3 mile runner by May 19<span data-fontsize="11">th</span>.  The new year arrived and we immediately started ramping up our running routine.   We first started with a 3 day a week program, which worked for a while, but as our long runs started to reach double digits, we migrated to a 4 day a week program.   We followed the plan religiously.  The relentless winter meant a lot of running in frigid temperatures on icy and snowy roads.  It also meant that we would not get a ton of training on trails.   It wasn’t until the last few weeks of training that we were able to move our runs exclusively to trails, but flat trails.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>As race day approached I was frantically reading race reports from prior years, watching any videos of the race I could find, and keeping my eye on the weather.   From what I had read, Sehgahunda would either be dry and very hot, or cool and very wet.    As the day approached, it was hard to tell which it would be.   A full night of rain the night before leading into the first hour of the race pretty much answered that question.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>This is not the first race I&#8217;ve run that was put on by Yellow Jacket Racing.   Just like the others I’ve been in, this was a first-class event.   Lots of volunteers, folks to help, music cranking, and the ever so important porta-potties located at the appropriate proximity to the start line.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4.jpg" rel="lightbox[2064]"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2068" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4-690x920.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4-435x580.jpg 435w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sehg4.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>At 7:40 AM, we heard the final call for the women runners.  They would be taking the start at 7:45.   I’m not even sure I remember them leaving, cuz I was so focused on what I had gotten myself into, but it only seemed like seconds later that they called the men to the line.   I wasn’t really sure where my pace would fall compared to others, but we lined up closer to the front of the line to avoid having to deal with extra congestion on the damp single track.   No sooner did we line up, and we were off.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>The first mile or so of single track was deceivingly kind.   We maintained a good pace and worked our way along.   Somewhere between mile 2 and 3 the main trail was very muddy and very slippery.   I had heard rumors of lots of mud on the spur trails out to the checkpoints but did not expect it this soon.   Fortunately, it did not last too long, and we continued on our way up and down the rolling terrain to the split to checkpoint 1.  At that time, we started to realize just how hard this race was going to be.  The trails out to the checkpoints are all up hill and very muddy…. Like want to pull your shoe off muddy.   We reached the checkpoint around mile 6 and were greeted by extremely helpful volunteers and table full of goodies to refuel with.   At each checkpoint volunteers would top off your bottles for you and make sure you were prepped for the next leg.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>It was less than 3 miles to the next checkpoint, but it seemed longer.   The run was similar to the first leg, but the frequency of the gullies started to increase a bit.   We still maintained a pretty decent pace and got to checkpoint 2 feeling pretty strong.   One nice thing about the checkpoints is that since they are two-way traffic, it gives you a chance to see how those that are ahead of you are doing.  The highlight of this stretch was when one runner in our group proclaimed that “we were missing the royal wedding” which brought on a well needed laugh.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>The 6 miles separating checkpoint 2 from checkpoint 3 were pretty tough.  The gullies were steeper and deeper and more frequent.     Many require very close attention to footing on the way down as it’s a narrow herd path along a steep bank.  Often times, a creek would be running at the base of the gully, and slippery shale can very quickly change the outcome of your day.  Before the race, I had made a mental note that checkpoint number 3 was going to be a tipping point in my race confidence.   It was just over halfway, which mentally was a key milestone.   By the time we got to the actual checkpoint, I was hurting.   I had been struggling to find the right amount of nutrition throughout the run, and I had run out of water about 4 ½ miles into this leg, and I was thirsty.   We spent a little extra time at this stop.  Volunteers were unbelievable, paying close attention to each runner, and helping everybody refuel.  There was also a pretty good group of spectators cheering us on.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>The next 11 miles of racing would be filled by 5 more checkpoints.  All of them had less than 3 miles between them, but those were all very long muddy miles.  The confidence I anticipated at this point in the race was completely missing.  Everything was starting to hurt so much that, though I was pretty sure we’d finish, my goal of finishing in under 6 ½ hours seemed to be in serious jeopardy.  My feet were pretty torn up from the miles of running in wet gritty socks, but at that point, I just had to suck it up and keep going.  I had read that there was a very tough climb around mile 18.  What I did not realize was that the next 7 miles were riddled with very tough climbs.   The group we were running with settled into a pattern of walking up the steep inclines and running the rest.   Being new to the event and exhausted, we followed suit.   It was a cycle of climb up, run a little level, run down, cross some ravines, and repeat.   The effort was immense, and despite running through some of the most gorgeous terrain that nature has to offer, the focus was clearly on survival.   At checkpoint 5 we asked someone if the worst of the climbing was over, and one runner kind of chuckled, as she told us the climb to checkpoint 6 was the worst.   Despite the chuckle, this was no joke.   Nonetheless, we pushed forward.   <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>Right around mile 23 we left the single track and had reached the point of the course where it was dirt road and greenway.   In typical Sehgahunda fashion, the dirt road started out with a steady climb that was slowing most competitors to a walk.  Once the hill was behind us we started to run.  All we had was a 5k left&#8230;. we&#8217;ve run hundreds of 5k distances.   At that point in the race, that was easier said than done, and we were not alone in that.   So, we&#8217;d pick a point ahead of us, usually the beginning of the slightest incline, and run to that point, walk a short distance, and take off running again.  Once again, each mile felt like ten, and it wasn&#8217;t until another runner came up on us and told us we were not that far that we caught our second wind.   At that point we were less than mile from the finish.   We continued down the greenway to the point where it hit pavement.   As we turned towards the finish, we were greeted with a steep climb on pavement.   We pushed our way up the hill and made the turn into the parking lot that led to the finish line.   Our pace picked up as we could hear the spectators cheering.   We made the final turn and did our best to sprint across the line, where every runner&#8217;s name was announced as they crossed the finish.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>We had done it.   We had finished a marathon, not just a marathon but a trail marathon, not just a trail marathon but Sehgahunda!!   We also did it well ahead of our projected time.  It was the hardest and most rewarding competitive event I&#8217;ve ever entered, and I had conquered it.   I&#8217;m not much of a bucket list person, but if I had a bucket and a checklist, this would be one big ole checkmark.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit that the rest of the day after the event is pretty foggy.   Between complete joy and complete exhaustion, I don&#8217;t really remember much of the rest of the day.   In the past two days of difficult walking and other aches and pains, I&#8217;ve had a chance to reflect on the event and a few things are now very clear to me&#8230;<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the fascinating aspects of the human mind, and often a frustrating aspect, is when we have an &#8220;a ha&#8221; moment, a lightbulb that goes off in our mind that makes something once unknown, seem perfectly clear. The fascinating part is a wonderfully clear vision on something that was once unseen-like LASIK surgery for the brain. The frustrating part is finally realizing something, potentially an important something, was right in front of your eyes, and you missed it for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fitbitownerrsz.jpg" rel="lightbox[1989]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1992" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fitbitownerrsz-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fitbitownerrsz-225x300.jpg 225w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fitbitownerrsz-330x440.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fitbitownerrsz-435x580.jpg 435w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fitbitownerrsz.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>I&#8217;m the &#8220;old dog&#8221; mentioned in the title. A 51 year old guy, who has had an on/off relationship with physical fitness my entire life. Staying fit, eating well, and being physically active while raising three kids and traveling a great deal for work, is never easy. I certainly had some low points. But, as the kids became more independent and the job changed, I&#8217;ve felt happy that I was winning the battle of being fit for several years. Unfortunately, I think I was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, I have been reasonably fit for several years now. Getting in my cardio, doing a lot strength training, discovering and enjoying Crossfit. What I was wrong about was treating physical fitness as a battle &#8211; and that&#8217;s where the Fitbit comes into play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m an internet junkie, and an information hound. Having an unquenchable thirst for information isn&#8217;t a bad thing, especially if you are looking for information related to physical fitness and healthy living. The problem wasn&#8217;t the information, but that the wealth of available information gave me too much confidence that &#8220;I had this fitness thing all figured out&#8221;. I have known about, and have friends and relatives that have used activity trackers for many years, but I never purchased one. It wasn&#8217;t that an activity tracker cost too much &#8211; I have thousands of dollars of weight stacks, dumbbells, kettlebells, and miscellaneous cardio equipment, so a $200 activity tracker wouldn&#8217;t have been unreasonable. Looking back, I probably never bought one because I thought they were &#8220;too simple&#8221;. How could a band around my wrist possibly help me? After all, I had already read 14,981 articles/blogs/websites related to fitness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, another personality trait &#8211; or personality flaw if you asked my wife, led me to buying a Fitbit Alta. I love bargains, and I love Amazon Prime. Those two loves intersected with a one-day only sale on the Alta for $69! With free 2 day shipping, of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My new Fitbit Alta arrived, and I quickly set it up and downloaded the Fitbit app to my iPhone. I configured my Alta to remind me to get 250 steps in for 11 hours a day, cute feature I thought. I also set some goals in the app &#8211; 10,000 steps a day, 5 miles, and 30 minutes of &#8220;activity&#8221;. Figured it was child&#8217;s play, but I like to follow rules, so I set everything up as recommended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now I was an official Fitbit user. In the beginning, I was mostly interested in the sleep monitoring and reporting feature. I figured that I had the daily activity stuff already figured out, but I hadn&#8217;t figured out a way to monitor my sleep patterns &#8211; because well, I was sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I usually set my exercise plan for the week first thing Monday morning. I am no longer a jogger due to microfracture surgery on my right knee, but I always got in my power walks with sprint intervals, my Crossfit, and weight training. The first day I wore my Fitbit I found it a little annoying. I work from home, sitting in front of a computer and on conference calls, most of the day. At 7:50am, my wrist vibrates and tells me I have 230 steps to reach my 250 for the hour. Similar &#8220;friendly reminders&#8221; come before each top of the hour, until noon. I hadn&#8217;t moved much, but I&#8217;m going for 42 minute power walk now (yes, I had my loop timed to the minute). I figured that would catch me up, and silence my little reminders for the hour. After finishing my walk, I was a bit surprised that I still had less than 5000 steps. I worked the rest of the afternoon &#8211; getting buzzed every hour that I was inactive. I did some Crossfit that evening with my wife, added in some dumbbell work, and I completed a &#8220;good day&#8221; of exercise according to my old standards &#8211; standards that I learned from the Internet, so they had to be right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Fitbit app basically laughed at me. I was active for more than 30 minutes in total, but I didn&#8217;t come close to 10,000 steps or 5 miles &#8211; and most importantly, I was basically inactive for the vast majority of the day. I decided to humor the simple device on my wrist the following days. Mostly because I&#8217;m hyper competitive and hate losing at something, and it&#8217;s especially painful losing to a skinny watch. Over the next few days, I figured out that you can ALWAYS find the time each hour to squeeze in at least 250 steps. And, spending those 10 free minutes that pop up during the day getting in some steps, instead of reading articles on fitness, actually improves your fitness &#8211; who knew?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I had figured out how to beat my simple Fitbit friend! I&#8217;ll keep that up, and get back to understanding that sleep pattern thing. I still planned my exercise for the week each Monday morning, but I found that I wasn&#8217;t taking as many power walks as I used to. By the time I&#8217;d go for a walk, I&#8217;d often have 5000-7000 steps in, and I knew I would blow past 10,000 for the day. I started doing more Crossfit and strength training during my &#8220;walk time&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting things started happening. I began sleeping better than I had in years, and without changing my diet, I was losing weight. I also was adding more muscle, and generally feeling better. Next I took my Fitbit on its first vacation &#8211; technically my wife&#8217;s and my beach vacation, but I wore my Fitbit throughout. I kept up with my daily goals, usually exceeding them because I had more time, and a funny thing happened. After eating and drinking &#8220;vacation calories&#8221; for 7 days, I came home and had only gained a pound or two. That was unheard of for me. It also shouldn&#8217;t have happened, because I wasn&#8217;t in my typical battle with fitness while on vacation. I took a &#8220;vacation&#8221; from fitness that week, so I could enjoy our vacation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s when the lightbulb went off. Without me realizing it, my Fitbit had changed my lifestyle. The physical fitness gains came in the form of losing some weight, adding some muscle, and sleeping better. The mental fitness gains came in the form of no longer feeling like every day was a battle with physical fitness. It is surprisingly draining to battle something every single day, and I have found that I&#8217;m much happier now that the battle is over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not intended to be a product review. I literally stumbled upon the Fitbit Alta, and only purchased it because of the deal. I&#8217;m sure there are many brands, and models, that are as good or better. I&#8217;m sharing my experience in case there&#8217;s someone like me, who is reading the internet for the next great &#8220;fitness&#8221; idea, and happens to stumble upon this story. I&#8217;m not sure if I had read this this exact account 5 years ago, what my reaction would have been. I may have discounted it as something &#8220;too simple&#8221;, but a $69 Fitbit has turned into the best piece of fitness equipment that I have ever purchased. I would be very happy if a fellow fitness fanatic in cyberspace happened to spend 10 minutes reading my story on the Internet, and it lead to a lifestyle change similar to what I&#8217;ve experienced &#8211; ironically, instead of spending those 10 minutes getting in some steps.</span></p>The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2017/08/fitbit-to-be-tied-teaching-an-old-dog-new-tricks/">Fitbit to be tied – Teaching an old dog new tricks</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com/2015/02/fitbit-flex-jumping-on-the-band-wagon/">FitBit Flex – Jumping on the Band Wagon</a> first appeared on <a href="https://relativelyrandom.com">Relatively Random</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was younger, I was a bit on the portly side.   I believe the politically correct term back then was &#8216;husky&#8217;.   A term so embraced that even the fine designers at Sears and Roebuck offered their famous Toughskins Jeans for the Husky kid.  Nothing puts a kid on the path to social mockery quicker than a pair of funky colored jeans, made by a nationally known tool store, with iron plated knees, and the word HUSKY clearly embossed on the patch on the back.  Fortunately as I approached the end of my high school years, I began to lose the husky label and some of the pain that came along with it, and began to get into shape&#8230;and have pretty much remained on that mission of moderate fitness to this day.</p>
<p>I tell you this story, not to relive painful childhood memories, but to make it very clear that I am not an olympic athlete, and also to level set the type of &#8216;athlete&#8217; that I am as I share my impression of the <a title="FitBit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/" target="_blank">FitBit</a> Flex.  I&#8217;m an exercise enthusiast&#8230;running a couple times each week, cycling, weight training, and running the occasional 5K or 10K race.</p>
<p>The Flex is a wristband style activity tracker that sells for $99USD.  FitBit places it in their &#8220;Everyday Fitness Products&#8221; category.  I had some previous experience with basic pedometers in the past, and had never been extremely impressed with their accuracy.  The Flex is leaps and bounds above those devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces.jpg" rel="lightbox[1002]"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="  wp-image-1015 alignright" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces-300x169.jpg" alt="FitBitFlexPieces" width="376" height="212" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces-300x169.jpg 300w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces-330x186.jpg 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces-690x388.jpg 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces-1050x591.jpg 1050w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexPieces-1031x580.jpg 1031w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></a>The Flex offers these key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steps</li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Distance Traveled</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Calories Burned</span></li>
<li class="li2">Active Minutes</li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Hours Slept</span></li>
<li class="li2">Quality of Sleep</li>
<li class="li2">Silent Alarm</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Flex does not have an actual display, it provides feedback towards your daily step goals with a series of 5 LED lights and syncs with your smart phone or computer to provide in-depth analysis of your daily activity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1014 aligncenter" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard-576x1024.png" alt="FitBitFlexDashboard" width="281" height="500" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard-576x1024.png 576w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard-169x300.png 169w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard-330x587.png 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard-690x1227.png 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard-1050x1867.png 1050w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard-326x580.png 326w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexDashboard.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></p>
<p>With the Flex, in addition to a charger and a wireless sync dongle for your computer, you also get two different sizes of wrist bands.   Mine is black, but it comes in nine other colors that you can choose from.   Charge it up, place it in the wrist band, put it on and start tracking.   Syncing with your smart phone is easy, and the app provides some great feedback throughout the day.   If you don&#8217;t have your smart phone with you, just tap the Flex a couple times, and the LED lights will light up to show your progress.  Each light represents 20% of your daily step goal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1016 size-medium alignright" src="http://www.relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep-169x300.png" alt="FitBitFlexSleep" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep-169x300.png 169w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep-576x1024.png 576w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep-330x587.png 330w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep-690x1227.png 690w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep-1050x1867.png 1050w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep-326x580.png 326w, https://relativelyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FitBitFlexSleep.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p>For sleep tracking, quickly tap the Flex about five times, and it will vibrate, the lights will blink, and it will go into &#8216;sleep tracking&#8217; mode.  This mode is actually quite fascinating.  It does its best to determine if you are asleep, awake, or restless.  Another great feature is the silent alarm.  Simply set the alarm time via the FitBit app on your phone and the wrist band will vibrate at the alarm time&#8230;without waking up the rest of the household.</p>
<p>I do quite a bit of walking and running, and I find the steps and distance to be very accurate.   When running on the treadmill, the Flex is giving me the same distance readings as the treadmill does.</p>
<p>The Flex is water resistant and seems pretty durable.  I&#8217;ve worn mine for all sorts of activities and it has held up well to all the abuse I&#8217;ve given it.   Battery life is about 5 days and recharge time only a couple hours.  I tend to put it on the charger at night to not lose any activity tracking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used my FitBit with both the iPhone and the Android App.  Both have performed very well.  The feedback provided is great, and there are even features to track other forms of exercise and food intake.</p>
<p>I have not tried other fitness trackers, so I can&#8217;t really say how the Flex compares to other products on the market.  If I were to buy all over again, I might upgrade to the FitBit Charge to get the Time display and some of the caller ID capabilities.   I do find it useful and fun to monitor my daily activity.   Given my typical level of exercise, I don&#8217;t necessarily find that I need the Flex to motivate me to remain active, but I enjoy tracking the trends.  Some of the more hardcore athletes that I know, specifically marathoners and triatheletes, seem less interested and see less value in a product like this.  But, for the greater population, especially those looking to increase their level of daily activity or are trying to avoid a trip back to the huskier days of their youth, the Flex is a great tool to get you moving and taking steps, or should I say making strides, to a healthier lifestyle.</p>
