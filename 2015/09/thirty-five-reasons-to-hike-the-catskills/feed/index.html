					<description><![CDATA[Another blessing from the Deats Family!  Thank you, Craig, for continuing and sharing the wonderful gift of making words come alive that God has given to the Deats boys.   From your grandfather and grandmother on down your family has inspired me, made me laugh, made me cry, and encouraged me to enjoy all that God has created and to reflect His glory in my life.   You are carrying on the legacy beautifully.   Betty George]]></description>
